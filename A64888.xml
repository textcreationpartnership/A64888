            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The Love which he bears to men hath inclined him to admit them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the pertaking of his Authority. And if he hath ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed intelligences in the Heavens to over-ſee their motions; he hath alſo decreed certain men upon the earth, who ſhould have the charge of reigning over Kingdomes. But though he hath inveſted all Kings with an abſolute Authority, yet he hath not indued them all with one and the ſame <hi>Genius.</hi> His Prudence, which guides all things by Weight, Number, and Meaſure, hath affected, that as in Painting there are <hi>Raphaels</hi> and <hi>Titians,</hi> whoſe pieces ſerve other Painters to learn the perfection of their Art; ſo there ſhould likewiſe be in Regality, <hi>Caeſars, Conſtantines,</hi> and <hi>Charlemains,</hi> whoſe Actions might be recorded as examples for all others. As it is ſaid in Philoſophy, <hi>(Perfectum in ſuo genere eſt menſura Caeterorum.)</hi> The worthieſt ſubject in every kind ſerves for a meaſure to all within its compaſſe. And who can refuſe to rank in this number the preſent King, under whoſe Scepter the Kingdome hath the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to be now governed? To ſpeak truth, his Actions have fixed the Kingdome in the higheſt point of glory, that many ages have ſeen; his Prudence, Valour, and Juſtice do ſhine with ſo much ſplendour, that without doubt, they are ſufficient to teach the Laws of Government to all other Princes. He never affected any Title
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:56802:6"/>but that of Juſt; becauſe he made choice of Juſtice for the rule of all his Actions; knowing that it was the moſt illuſtrious perfection in all Kings, that it was it, which rendered their Majeſty moſt venerable. That it was it, which gave a good ſucceſſe to all their enterprizes; and laſtly, that this was it which was the ſtrongeſt Prop of Peace.

His digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty maketh him the greateſt of Kings; his Power the ſtrongeſt; his Conduct the wiſeſt; his Treaſuries the Richeſt, and his Vertue the moſt juſt. We have ſeen ſome Clouds ariſe, which have ſeemed to obſcure his light; but they have onely ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to ſet off with advantage the wonders of his Conduct, and he hath ever diſpel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led from us all thoſe Tempeſts of Miſ-fortunes which have threatned <hi>France.</hi> He hath the Honour to be Son to a Father, to whom a thouſand ill ſtrious acts have acquired the quality of Great.

Heaven ſeems to have made a Bargain with him that he ſhould overthrow whatever reſiſted him, that his actions ſhould be as ſo many miracles, and that his reign ſhould be full as happy in the obedience and love of his Subjects, as illuſtrious by his victories and triumphs. Which being ſo, how can we paſs by ſo many glorious Actions without publiſhing his Wiſdome and Generoſity? were not that not onely to deny to his Valour the praiſe it juſtly vindicates, but even to deprive Poſterity of an example whereby it might learn what no books of Policy can teach? It is not fit to publiſh the ſecrets of a Prince, but it is juſt to declare his vertues: And if the firſt be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid by the Laws of Secrecy, the acknowledgement which is due to their merit, and the zeal of the Publick good obligeth us to the ſeco<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

I confeſs, I am not able to find words equal to the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his Actions; but I had rather want words, then acknowledgements for my King, and affection for my Country. but I ſhall nevertheleſs hope to acquit my ſelf ſo much the more fortunately, as the heroick Actions of great Princes, have often rendred thoſe eloquent who have undertook to write them.</p>
               <p>A Prince who would ſignalize himſelf by an extraordinary conduct ought to chuſe Miniſters, who are ſufficiently able to aſſiſt him with their counſels, and to put them in execution. For the better chooſing of whom, I think it convenient to obſerve with <hi>T. Livy,</hi> that there are three ſorts of them.</p>
               <p>The firſt <hi>Eminent,</hi> who are able to govern all by their own diſcretions, and who have a Prudence vigorous enough, to adviſe of themſelves whatſoever is neceſſary for Government without being beholding to others; who ſee all, penetrate into all, judge of all, and whoſe <hi>Genius</hi> is ſtrong enough to bear up the weight of the greateſt affairs.</p>
               <p>The ſecond may be called <hi>Indifferent,</hi> who have not ſufficiency enough to judge of all things, or to execute them, but have a good capacity to apprehend the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of others in their Counſel, and ſo to govern affairs by their directions, that they are often times ſucceſſefull in the greateſt enterprizes.</p>
               <p>The third and laſt have ſo little <hi>Judgement,</hi> that they are neither able to manage
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:56802:6"/>affairs by their own, or the advices of others; whence it happens, that they are apt to commit very deplorable faults, and to put all things into Confuſion. Of the firſt rank ought a Prince to chooſe his miniſters, if he would deſign any great attempts, or carry them on to a good ſucceſs. If he himſelf too, be of this number, they will bring wonders to paſſe, if he be not, he hath ſo much the more need to have perſons of this temper neer him. For God who hath naturally ſubjected little things to great, ſeems to have given Letters Pattents to eminent ſpirits, to govern; if not by their Authority, at leaſt by their Counſels, the reſt of Mankind. It is a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous fault to chooſe Miniſters at a venture; and for that reaſon <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> blamed the Athenians, who chuſed their Magiſtrates by Lot, it being abſolutely neceſſary to elect them by Prudence, and ſtill to prefer the moſt capable. The Proverb ſaith, <hi>Ex quolibet ligno non fit Mercurius,</hi> a Sowes Ear wil not make a Silk-Purſe; and true it is, that not all are proper for all affairs. Men muſt be fitted to their Commiſſions, leaſt they not having abilities proportionable, do not onely ruine the moſt glorious deſigns, but withall, make them end in great miſ-fortunes. If men have never at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chieved any thing greater then States and Empires, ſurely they cannot do any thing more glorious, then to govern them well; and ſince Cauſes ought to be proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned to effects, it is neceſſary to imploy great Perſons in great places. That ſight which ſhould pierce into the remoteſt Objects ſhould be the ſharpeſt. That Arm which ſhould throw furtheſt, ought to be ſtrongeſt; that light which ſhould ſhine in many places, ought to be livelieſt; and generally all cauſes which ſhould have moſt force in their operation, ſhould have moſt vigour in then power. Which being ſo, ought not the underſtanding of a Miniſter to be quicker, then that of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, ſeeing be is to dive into truths? His Memory, ought it not to be ſtronger, ſeeing it ought to preſerve more <hi>Species?</hi> ought not his Soul to be more capable, ſeeing it ought to be more Univerſal? ought not his Wiſdome to be greater, ſince he muſt comprehend more reaſon? and ought not his Prudence to be more perſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacious, ſeeing he is obliged to provide for the greateſt and moſt important affairs? An ordinary capacity of mind is ſufficient for the guiding of a private life, but he who hath the charge of governing a State, ought to ſurpaſs all others in the ſtrength of his <hi>Genius.</hi> God who is the firſt reaſon and mover of Nature, may be his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample in this kind, and of neceſſity who ſo doth ſerve next under him in the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of a Kingdome, ought to be indued with a more vigorous wiſdome then others; that he may be as the underſtanding Soul in a civil Society, and a guider of all others motions by his own Councels. Not to follow this rule, were to put all into confuſion and diſorder, and one of the greateſt vanities which is under the Sun, ſaith the Spirit of God in the Scriptures, is, To place Fools upon the Tribunal, and to leave Wiſe men ſtanding upon the ground. It were to ſet a Sailor to the Helm, and the Pilot to the Oar; it were to commit the guidance of the <hi>Primum mobile,</hi> to the laſt or the leaſt of all the Celeſtial Spheres.</p>

                  <head>The Reception of the Cardinal into the Adminiſtration of the STATE.</head>
                  <p>THoſe eminent qualities which raiſed the Cardinal from above the pitch of other men, induced the Queen mother to preſent him to the King her Son, to aſſiſt his Councels, which qualifications, had not been alone ſufficient for the Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration, if not accompanied with Fidelity. Although this Vertue ſeems to have leſſe ſplendor then others, yet this is it which is ſo needfull a quality, that the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt Souls are not proper for that condition if their Ambition, Covetouſneſs, or their private intereſt, are able to divert them upon any occaſion whatſoever. But in whom did it ever appear with ſo much ſplendor, as in the Cardinal, who did al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies make it his end, never to ſeek for Honour and Wealth but in his Majeſties ſervice? Which his Majeſty had very ſingular proofs of, by his management of thoſe important Affairs, whileſt he was Secretary of State, and he had one moſt ample particular aſſurance of it, in his removal from the Court; during all which
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:56802:7"/>time, his Majeſty could never find that he held the leaſt intelligence with the Queen Mother, or thoſe Grandees of State, to make Cabals contrary to his Authority, though he had underſtanding enough not to be ignorant of ſome means which ſerve to imbroyl things on ſuch occaſions. At firſt he was contented to Officiate like a good Prelate in his own Dioceſs, without medling in any publick affairs, but thoſe which are common to all good French men, who have any knowledge thereof; and being afterwards removed into <hi>Avignon,</hi> he had no other intention, but of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſing with his Books, and ſuch vertues as are required in thoſe of his Coat; teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying by this great reſervedneſs, that he was ſo much the more worthy of thoſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments, which had formerly been conferred upon him, according to that of the wiſe Polititians, There are none fitter to command, then thoſe who obey with mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration and fidelity; the reaſon is, in obeying they learn to command, and that all men do willingly ſubmit to them, who being private men have lived modeſtly and in-offenſively. But how could the King be capable of the leaſt ſuſpicion of his Fidelity, after that one Procedure of his which was ſeen by the whole Nation, when he was recalled from <hi>Avignon,</hi> to divert the Queen Mother from thoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns, which they who had adviſed her to with-draw from <hi>Bloys</hi> to <hi>Angouleſm,</hi> did perſwade unto her? It was no little honour for him, to ſee that they who had ſo ill created him, did yet believe he had ſincerity enough to ſerve them in ſuch an occaſion as that was. He got an accruement of Glory too, by his Loyalty in his quick diſpatch to that great Princeſs, and by declaring to thoſe Grandees then with her, that whatever opportunities he had to make them repent of thoſe injuries they had done him, yet he would never deceive or betray them.</p>
                  <p>The Queen Mother was in a good Hold, the greateſt part of the Princes and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Lords offered her their ſervice; inſomuch that would he have joyned the facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of his mind to thoſe forces which they might have raiſed, he might have held them ſo much play, that they would have found themſelves intangled. It ſeemed he was invited to teſtifie a ſenſible apprehenſion in the Queen his Miſtreſſes behalf, he having received from her hands many ſignal favours in recompence of the ſervices he had done unto her, and that then he had nothing to hope for but her good opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, ſo much had thoſe Gentlemen thwarted him. But neither the reſentments of former indignities, nor his indeavours in his Miſtreſſes behalf, nor the hopes of a greater Fortune, nor the conſideration of his own intereſt, could ever ſo little ſhake him in his Fidelity. After he was arrived at <hi>Angouleſm,</hi> and that his own merit had reſtored him to that place of eſteem, which he formerly held in her Majeſties good favour, he propoſed no other end in his diſcourſe, but to ſet her right with the King. He preſently aſſured her, that he ſuffered in the diſaſters to which her enemies had brought her, and not reſting barely there, he made uſe of this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion, to inſinnuate himſelf more effectually into her ſoul, and to gain a greater power over her ſpirit, that he might improve to advantage the charms, which his complaiſant humour had given him, and ſhewed clearly to her, that if ſhe thought it her miſ-fortune, not to be Miſtreſs of his Majeſties Perſon and Councel, her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition would be much more to be deplored, ſeeing ſhe was no better then a Slave to the deſigns and Wills of thoſe who hurried her into broyls, and that ſhe could not chuſe a worſe party into whoſe hands ſhe might commit the management of her own intereſt. Hee made it evident to her, that Arms were but a weak means in <hi>France</hi> to reſtore people to the Government, ſeeing his Majeſties have been ever Victorious; they who provoke him doe but totally deſtroy themſelves. Of this truth, he produced ſeveral examples, which are recorded in all Revolts from time to time: Laſtly, he convinced to her, that ſhe might with eaſe re-aſſume that Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority from whence ſhe was fallen, would ſhe but re-unite hers with the Kings in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts; that if ſhee ſhould not obtain all at the firſt daſh, ſhee ought to expect ſome thing from time, but with confident aſſurance, that the King her ſon had ſuch natural reſentments for her, that they alone would force him, to accord her whatever ſhe could with reaſon expect, though he were not invited to it by her pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, or the Counſels of thoſe who had the honour to be her ſervants. That du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:56802:7"/>her ſeparating her ſelf from his Majeſty, ſhe could hope for nothing but ſcorn and debility, whereas ſhe ſhould no ſooner oblige his Majeſty by reſtoring to him, her heart and affections, but ſhe would find her ſelf attended back to the Court, honoured and obeyed by all the world as ſhe was formerly wont to be. Theſe were ſome of thoſe reaſons which he laid before her; and true it is, that his Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence animated with his Fidelity, induced her to reſolve upon that Accommodati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which hath ſo long kept their Majeſties in a ſtrict union, and <hi>France</hi> in ſo ſweet a repoſe.</p>
                  <p>His Majeſty did better underſtand then any other perſon, all the particulars of the Cardinals negotiation, and apprehended ſo great an eſteem of his Fidelity, that he thought no conſideration able to undermine it; and ſeeing that one, accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with many other eminent qualities, hee was eaſily convinced, that he had not in his whole Kingdome, a perſon more capable or worthy of the Adminiſtration then himſelf. Who can deſcribe with what dexterity the whole face of Affairs were changed, which before were managed but lamely and by halfs? Whereas hee conforming himſelf to thoſe inclinations, which carried his Majeſty to great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns, perſwaded him to ſet them forwards, and aſſiſted him in their execution. Formerly all affairs were carried without ſecrecy, ſo that ſtrangers had all the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence of their reſolutions; which they diſ-appointed and obſtructed, before they were in a forwardneſs to be ſet on foot. But this great Miniſter, knowing ſecrecy to be the Soul of Counſel, and that none are better then thoſe which continue un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known even after the execution, brought forth every day wonders effected by his Prudence, of which the Grandees themſelves had not ſo much as a thought. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it was ſo much the eaſier for him ſo to do, his Majeſty being the moſt ſecret Prince that ever was. Formerly, every one was impatient at the obſtacles and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lays of the Marqueſs <hi>de la Vieville;</hi> whereas after his eſtabliſhment, all thoſe who had any affairs to negotiate or repreſent, for his Majeſties ſervice, were over-joyed that they were to Treat with a Miniſter, whoſe Countenance was a Throne of ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and bounty, and whoſe words have ſo powerfull a Charm, that they ſtill went away ſatisfied, what ever difficulties were propoſed by them. Beſides, they were conſtrained, as it were to pay him all reſpects; and the Gravity too, which the Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces have beſtowed upon him, is ſo agreeable and taking, that the reſpect which it begets in the ſoules of men, never thwarts that love which is due unto him, and that love doth not at all hinder them from fearing to diſpleaſe him.</p>
                  <p>The ancient Allies of this Crown, formerly left for a prey to their enemies, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to be confident to him, as ſoon as ever they had known him, and finding that his <hi>Genius</hi> did not terminate in a meer defenſive, they betook them to their Arms, not onely to oppoſe thoſe unjuſt Uſurpations, which were made upon them, but alſo to aſſault and ſet upon thoſe who had began them. In ſhort, as he never declared himſelf to be for any Faction; but on the contrary, ſhewed himſelf much averſe to all Rebellions; both the Grandees of the Kingdome and <hi>Hugonots</hi> too, were not long to learn that it would become them for the future, to live within the limits of their obedience: And laſtly, not being able to away with any Mutiny, he ſoon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to make them take ſome courſe of living, which is the ſureſt foundation of Peace in a Kingdome: ſo that every one had the content to ſee <hi>France</hi> flouriſh, both at home and abroad, and to acquire its former luſtre, which hath alwaies made it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged to be the firſt Kingdome of <hi>Europe.</hi>

                  <p>THe firſt conſiderable affair, which preſented it ſelf after the Cardinals admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to the Adminiſtration, was the Marriage of the Lady <hi>Henrietta Maria,</hi> his Majeſties Siſter, with <hi>Charles</hi> Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> the preſent King of <hi>Great Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.</hi> The Spaniard had a long time feared it would be made up, knowing that if <hi>France</hi> and <hi>England</hi> were leagued together, they would become ſo conſiderable as
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:56802:8"/>that they would without difficulty fruſtrate and bring all his deſigns to nothing; ſo he indeavoured to hinder it by pretending a deſire himſelf had to contract an Alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with <hi>England;</hi> and accordingly hee propoſed to match his <hi>Infanta</hi> with the Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> giving ſome hopes by <hi>Paraquance,</hi> that he would reſtore the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latinate, though he had as little mind to deliver it, as the King of <hi>Great Brittain</hi> had earneſt Paſſion to recover it. He held on this Treaty at leaſt twelve years, yet finding every day new excuſes, to defer the concluſion of it: But at laſt the King of <hi>Great Brittain,</hi> detected his deceipt, which had lain hid under thoſe delays, and found out, that his deſign was onely to gain time, untill all the daughters of <hi>France</hi> were married elſewhere: at leaſt he had great conjectures of it; to clear all, and bring it to a concluſion, he thought good that the Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> ſhould in perſon go into <hi>Spain.</hi> Hee had not been there many dayes, before it was known, both to himſelf and thoſe of his Counſel, that they had been untill that time entertained with vain hopes, however he would not make known his reſentments in a ſtrange Country, where he might receive much damage by it, but being return'd into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> he informed King <hi>James</hi> his Father of it, with ſo much anger, that they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to break with him, rather ſooner then later to avoid expoſing themſelves to the diſ-eſteem which other Princes might have of their management of this affair; and withall to countenance the breach by the Parliaments approbation. This re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve was as ſoon executed as concluded, and King <hi>James</hi> having ſummoned a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, at leaſt to conſult on a means for recovery of the Palatinate, informed them of the many reaſons which he had to beleeve, that the Spaniards had no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of concluding thoſe Propoſitions of marriage which had been ſo long in Treaty; that the onely end of their deſign was, to gain time and to fortifie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the Palatinate, and ſo to ſettle themſelves there, that ſhortly it would be impoſſible to remove them thence, and therefore hee thought it fit no longer to hearken after it. The Parliament were induced with ſo much the more eaſe, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve theſe reaſons, they having teſtified on divers occaſions, their ſuſpicions of the Spaniſh tricks, and in concluſion, thought good not to regard any more their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions of the Match. But the King of <hi>Great Brittain</hi> ſtayed not long there, for the Prince of <hi>Wales</hi> his ſon (who had now good eſteem of <hi>France,</hi> and a liking for the Kings Siſter whom he had ſeen, as he paſſed thorough that Court, without diſcovering himſelf) had perſwaded him to give him leave to ſeek for that Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs in marriage, which was propoſed in Parliament, and carried without much dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty for many reaſons which were there alledged; particularly, That the French being accuſtomed to live with thoſe of their Religion, it was to be beleeved, they would not make ſuch extraordinary demands in behalf of the Catholicks, as the Spaniard would have done. It was then reſolved to diſpatch an Ambaſſadour into <hi>France,</hi> who might lay the firſt foundation of that Treaty; ſo that the King forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with made choice of the Earls of <hi>Carliſle</hi> and <hi>Holland.</hi> The latter ſet forward about <hi>Mid-May.</hi> He had order firſt to wait on the King alone, and to pretend the intereſts of the Palatinate, but indeed to diſcover how they would reſent his Propoſal, and if rejected, not to make any more noiſe of it; accordingly hee met his Majeſty and <hi>Compiegne,</hi> he began to conſider about means to recover the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latinate, and then acquainted him with a great deal of dexterity, that the King his Maſter deſired his Son the Prince of <hi>Wales</hi> might marry his ſiſter. The King who underſtoood that Propoſals of this nature, how remote ſoever ought not to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived but with honour, teſtified that he had a great eſteem of it, and forthwith debated it with his Miniſters, to give him an anſwer; it was concluded, That this Match was very convenient for the Quality of his Majeſties Siſter; That in the whole Empire there was not any more hopefull: That Hiſtory records above twenty Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liances between <hi>France, England,</hi> and <hi>Scotland:</hi> That it would be eaſie to aſſure her Ladyſhip the exerciſe of her Religion, conſidering what had been granted to the Spaniard: That great Princeſſes are in this particular, in a worſe condition than Ladies of a meaner Quality, by reaſon half an Age hardly produceth a Match correſpondent to their Birth, ſo that having once loſt their opportunities, they live to ſee the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:56802:8"/>of their Beauties reaped by years, without ever marrying; whereupon it was reſolved to ſee what particular Propoſals would be made, this reſult was ſignified to the Earl of <hi>Holland,</hi> who aſſured them that the King his Maſter would receive it with much joy, yet deferring to enter into any further Treaty, untill he had received particular inſtructions from his Majeſty. Who upon the receiving of that news, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched with all diligence, the Earl of <hi>Carliſle,</hi> with full power to conclude the Match. The Earl of <hi>Holland</hi> went to <hi>Amiers</hi> to meet him, that they might confer together what they had to do, and afterwards being come near to <hi>Campeign,</hi> the King hearing of it, commanded the Duke of <hi>Cheuruſe,</hi> to go receive them with twelve Coaches full of Nobility, and withall to entertain them magnificently, and defray their charges during their abode at Court. The day after their arrival, they had Audience given them, and the Propoſals which they made appeared ſo rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, that the King preſently judging that they might eaſily be reſolved, appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Commiſſioners to treat with them. The Cardinal was at that time newly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced to the Adminiſtration, but he made it apparent, that he was not a Novice in the management of it; for the King deſiring his opinion of this Treaty, he not onely added many other reaſons to thoſe alledged in the firſt conſultation; but moreover ſuggeſted to his Majeſty ſuch judicious means to carry on the buſineſs, that he could not enough admire his Prudence.</p>
                  <p>Amongſt other reaſons of the commodiouſneſs of this Match, hee repreſented to him, that <hi>England</hi> once leagued with <hi>France</hi> by this Alliance, there was hopes that they would joyn their Forces to aſſiſt the German Princes, ſince it was yet more for the Intereſt of <hi>England</hi> then <hi>France,</hi> to re-eſtabliſh them; which being ſo, their powers would not onely ballance thoſe of the houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> but over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poize them too, with never ſo little aſſiſtance from thoſe Princes: That the happy ſucceſſe which would follow, would adde as much Glory to his Crown and State, as diſcredit and confuſion to his enemies: Moreover, that it being very expedient to curb the Inſolencies of the <hi>Hugonots,</hi> this marriage would be of great uſe, as well becauſe it would with-hold the King of <hi>Great Brittain,</hi> from aſſiſting them, as alſo, becauſe it might be a means to procure ſhipping from him for the reducing of <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chel;</hi> in ſhort, That there was great hopes to beleeve, the Princeſs might much ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance the Catholick Religion in <hi>England,</hi> if as there was no doubt ſhe were beloved by the King and the Prince her Husband. So that of all ſides there was nothing Prognoſticated but great happineſſe, judging it requiſite, to uſe addreſſe and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence for the ſpeedy effecting of it.</p>
                  <p>The King did very wel reliſh the Conſideration, and thereupon commanding him to have a particular eye upon the Treaty, his judgement which preſently penetrates into affairs, and quickneth expeditions, did negotiate it with ſo ready a Conduct, that he ſhortly brought it to ſuch a paſſe that it might receive a Concluſion; and that which I finde in it moſt to be admired, is, That the ſucceſs hath ſhewed he was not miſtaken in his conjecture. <hi>England</hi> alſo did forthwith joyn with <hi>France,</hi> to give means to <hi>Mansfield</hi> to enter with a puiſſant Army into <hi>Germany,</hi> that he might at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt the re-eſtabliſhment of the Palatine; and the year following, the King of <hi>Great Brittain</hi> ſent ſhips to the King, which helped him to gain a glorious Naval victory againſt thoſe of <hi>Rochel.</hi> The ſame effects had aſſuredly continued without the Intregues of Madam <hi>de Cheuruſe,</hi> without the ill conduct of ſome who accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied the Princeſs, and without the death of King <hi>James.</hi> For his Majeſty from that time ſhewed himſelf ſo affectionate to <hi>France,</hi> that one day he openly ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore divers Lords of the Court, that the King had gained more upon him, then any of his Predeceſſors, and that he would not onely imploy his Subjects lives, but his own too, in defence of his intereſts, and to oppoſe the Rebels who ſhould attempt any Inſurrections in <hi>France;</hi> and leſſe could not be expected from the Princeſs in the behalf of Religion, if death had not prevented that Monarch from ſeeing the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage conſummated; for the Paſſion which he had already in her behalf, though he had never ſeen her was ſo ſenſible, that he was heard ſay, with a great deal of ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, which was taken notice of amongſt other diſcourſe of the ſame nature;
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:56802:9"/>That he would quarrel with her becauſe ſhe would not read his Letter, nor that of the Prince his ſon, without leave from the Queen her Mother, but withall that he was much bound to her, becauſe after ſhe had read them, ſhe laid his under her Pillow, but his ſons in her Boſome, to ſhew that ſhe did rely upon him, and lodge his ſon in her heart.</p>

To which for the preſent the Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors replied, That the King their Maſter, had not procured the Parliaments con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent for this Alliance with <hi>France,</hi> and breaking off that with <hi>Spain,</hi> but in conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, that they would not have been ſo ſtrict, in requiring ſo many favours in behalf of the Catholicks; and withal, that it was held there as a fundamental Law not to grant them any freedomes by reaſon of many great inconveniences, which would in time happen to their State. The Cardinal was not wanting to reply, that he was well informed neither the King or Parliament, were induced to break with the Spaniards untill they were convinced, that their Treaty was onely feigned, and that they had other deſigns, then of giving the Infanta to the Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> and as for what related to the Peace of the State (he anſwered) that the liberty which was granted to the Catholicks, could not trouble it, ſeeing experience hath eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced it on a thouſand occaſions, that there is not any thing which doth more ſtir up People to Commotions, then the reſtraint which is impoſed upon the exerciſe of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, That, that is it, which incites people to ſhake off the yoke of their obedience, and that never any thing but miſ-fortunes have followed that Prince, who would force men in that beleef which they had a long time imbraced: That in truth, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion might by fire and ſword be deſtroyed and rooted out, before it be fully ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in the ſoul; but after that, it will be ſo far from being changeable by force, that rather on the contrary, violence will but ferment and fix it ſo much the more; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thoſe things are more difficult then the, care which ought to be had for their conſervation. That in effect, this Maxime was verified in <hi>France,</hi> where the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty which was granted to the <hi>Hugonots</hi> by the Edict of Peace, had converted a far greater number then all the rigours of puniſhment and war. Theſe reaſons were ſo ſtrong that the Engliſh Embaſſadours found themſelves unable to anſwer any thing againſt it. But it was not ſufficient to perſwade them, the King of <hi>Great Brittains</hi> conſent was needfull. It cannot be denied, but there were great hopes of obtaining it, conſidering his particular inclination, he himſelf being well diſpoſed to be converted, and that he was alſo ſatisfied in Conſcience concerning the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal difficulties, in the Catholick Beleef, and had permitted the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Ambrun</hi> (ſent at his intreaty by the King, to ſound him upon ſome other points) to adminiſter the Sacrament of Confirmation to above twenty thouſand Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks in <hi>London;</hi> indeed it was apprehended a little hazardous, leſt the Parliament ſhould not conſent to it, they having a great power in the reſolution of affairs. This difficulty induced the King after the Cardinal had informed him of it, to ſend the Marqueſs <hi>de Effiat</hi> into <hi>England,</hi> in the quality of an extraordinary Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour, to negotiate all the affairs which related to the marriage. In his inſtructions were particular orders, to indeavour to perſwade his Majeſty of <hi>Great Brittain,</hi> to like well of thoſe reaſons which the Cardinal had imparted to his Embaſſadour,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:56802:10"/>and moreover, to tell him in particular, that conſidering the Parliament was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of Proteſtants and Puritans, he ought to ſuſpect them on this occaſion, that himſelf being party againſt them, there was no apparence of any reaſon, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay that which concerned the Catholicks Intereſt; Moreover, that it was danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous for a Soveraign, to uſe violence towards his ſubjects in matter of Religion, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that it teacheth to deſpiſe life; and who ſo deſpiſeth his own life, is maſter of any other mans, of what condition ſo ever he be. That this conſtraint is repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to the ſafety of Kings, of which in Hiſtory are many examples, eſpecially in theſe latter ages. Theſe reaſons were very conſiderable, but withall the Marqueſs <hi>D' Effiat,</hi> followed them home with ſuch addreſs, and vigour that they made the ſame impreſſions upon the Kings, as they had done upon his Embaſſadours minds, who indeed did much contribute by their Letters, to bring it to a reſolution.</p>

                  <p>That the children which ſhould be born of this marriage, ſhould be brought up in the Catholick Religion untill the age of 13 years by the Princeſs.</p>

                  <p>That the King of <hi>Great Britain</hi> ſhould be obliged to treat her and her Family with that Port which was fit for one of her quality that there ſhould be fifty thouſand crowns in Jewels preſented to her, by the King of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> as a marriage favour, which ſhould remain to her and hers, as well as thoſe which ſhe then had, as alſo ſuch as ſhe ſhould have in future.</p>
                  <p>That ſhe ſhould have the free diſpoſal of Benefices and Offices, in thoſe lands which ſhould be given her in Dower, and that one of thoſe lands ſhould be a Dutchie
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:56802:11"/>or an Earldome, that it ſhould be lawfull for her in her Widdow-hood, to return into <hi>France,</hi> whether ſhe had children, or not, that in caſe ſhe ſhould return, the King of <hi>Great Brittain</hi> ſhould conduct her at his own proper charges to <hi>Callis,</hi> with ſuch honour as ſhould be fit for one of her quality.</p>
                  <p>That her houſe ſhould be furniſhed with ſuch dignity, and ſhould be filled with as many Officers, as any Princeſs yet had, or as had been accorded to the <hi>Infanta</hi> of <hi>Spain,</hi> upon the late Treaty which had been propoſed. Briefly, that for the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance of theſe conditions, he, of the two Kings, who ſhould be deficient to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh what belongeth on his part to do, ſhould be bound to pay four hundred thouſand crowns to the other, as a penalty for breach of them.</p>
                  <p>This was as much ſecurity as could be had for the preſent, but one thing is not to be forgotten, which was, that all the Treaty, all the promiſes given and taken, and all the Acts which were concluded on, paſſed in the Kings name, as the Perſon, to whom the marrying of the Princeſſes of the Bloud did really appertain, and which he might do according to his own pleaſure, and upon ſuch conditions as he ſhould think fit; whereas they are onely concern'd to give their conſents both to the Perſons and Articles which are reſolved on.</p>
                  <p>Cuſtome, may raiſe obſtacles againſt marriages and make them void<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if there bee any defect of following the uſual order which is preſcribed. The Popes have found by the Canon Law, that they have this Power: Particularly <hi>Alexander</hi> the third, who when a Biſhop asked him the Queſtion, whether Marriage between the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of two Goſſips were allowable, anſwered him, yes, in caſe the cuſtome of the Country did permit it. But I ſhall ſay moreover, that the ſame Pope hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared that there might be ſuch Cuſtomes in <hi>France,</hi> which might annull marriages, though on the other ſide, thoſe of <hi>Rome</hi> may licenſe them. According to that anſwer, which was made to the Biſhop of <hi>Amiers,</hi> who deſiring to know if a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage made with a Eunuch were good, was anſwered, that the general cuſtome of the French Church, was to diſſolve it, and he was contented ſo to permit it, though the Roman Church uſed the contrary. It is the Cuſtome of <hi>France,</hi> that no Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes or Ladies of great quality, whoſe marriages may be of concern to the State, may marry, but by and with the Kings order and conſent. The ſecond Race of our Kings furniſheth us with an example very remarkable, in the marriage of <hi>Judeth</hi> Widdow of <hi>Edmulph</hi> King of <hi>England,</hi> who being married without the conſent of <hi>Charles</hi> the Bauld, with <hi>Bauldwin</hi> grand Forreſtier, and afterwards firſt Earl of <hi>Flanders<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> he declared the ſaid marriage to be nul by the Prelates &amp; Clergy of <hi>France.</hi> aſſembled at <hi>Senlis,</hi> though ſhe were at her own diſpoſal, by her firſt marriage and royalty, though Pope <hi>Nicholas</hi> the firſt, would have pickt a quarrel at it, and have confirmed it. Some one perchance, not well informed, may ſuppoſe, that this Pope wanted courage, but there is no reaſon for it: ſeeing he had ſpirit enough to excommunicate <hi>Lotharius</hi> for marrying a ſecond wife, leaving his firſt, though his Clergy at <hi>Merz</hi> and <hi>Calogue<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> did favour him to conſtrain him to quit his laſt Wife, and to receive his firſt; as alſo to diſpoſſeſs two Biſhops, who had Abetted the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order; the true reaſon is, he knew that the Cuſtome of <hi>France</hi> did not permit <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dith</hi> to re-marry without the Kings conſent. The third Race, affords us another proof, reported by a Hiſtorian<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who deſerves ſo much the rather to be credited, he being generally known for one of the enemies of <hi>France.</hi> It was the marriage contracted by <hi>Proxy,</hi> between <hi>Maximilian,</hi> and <hi>Anne</hi> of <hi>Brittain.</hi> It's true, it was not conſummated as that of <hi>Judith</hi> was; but becauſe it was concluded without the conſent of <hi>Charles</hi> the Eighth one of our Kings. His Majeſty making uſe of his Power, declared it Null, by reaſon of that default. In fine, it was allowed for naught, and both parties remained Free, <hi>Maximilian</hi> afterwards marrying <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garet</hi> of <hi>Milan;</hi> and <hi>Charles</hi> the Eighth married the ſame <hi>Anne</hi> of <hi>Brittain,</hi> and no one doubted the validity of either of the marriages.</p>
                  <p>If theſe examples evince to us, the Antiquity of this Cuſtome, and how the Church hath allowed of it, we cannot ſuſpect or doubt, but that they are grounded upon juſt reaſons, ſeeing the marriages of perſons of ſuch quality, are of great importance
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:56802:11"/>to the State, and ordinarily are the originals of Peace or War, and ſerve for a Stair-Caſe to ſuch, who aſpiring higher then they ought, raiſe enterprizes againſt the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty, as <hi>Cornelius Tacitus</hi> hath obſerved; it doth therefore reſt ſafely to bee concluded on, that the Princeſſes of <hi>France</hi> cannot lawfully marry without the Kings conſent. So that neither men or women who have had them in their poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, did never make a difficulty to promiſe, either by Oath, or any other aſſurance, that they would not contract them in any marriage without their conſents and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation.</p>

                  <p>THe reſpect wherewith the King had ever honoured the Holy Father, made him reſolve with the Engliſh Embaſſadours in the firſt Article of the Treaty, That in conſideration of that diverſity of Religion, between the Princeſs and the Prince of <hi>Wales</hi> his Majeſty ſhould ſend to his Holineſs to procure a Diſpenſation before the Marriage were effected, to obtain the ſaid Diſpenſation, the Cardinal propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to the King, to ſend Father <hi>Berule,</hi> Superior General of the fathers of the Oratory, and to commit the charge of it to him, as a perſon capable of ſuch a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiation and whoſe Piety (which amongſt the People is extreamly recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able) might take off all ſhadows or apparencies, which the weakneſs of their ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, or the malice of the Spaniards might raiſe abroad concerning it.

But that the Honour which hee owed to the Holy Chair, and in particular to his Sanctity, who had formerly held him at the Font of Baptiſm, in the name of Pope <hi>Clement</hi> the Eighth, had not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted him to conclude upon the Treaty, before the obtainment of his Diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

After all this, his Inſtructions did not oblige him to be contented with words onely as to that which concern'd the Libertie of the Catholiques, ſo that he proceeded with great earneſtneſs to obtain the effects of it; and he was aſſured that upon the concluſion of the Mariage, there ſhould be a Patent of Enlargement granted to all ſuch as were Priſoners for their Religion-ſake, without being any more troubled for the future; and for what related to all in general, there was a Deed made under his Majeſties own Hand and Seal, directed to the Lord <hi>Conway,</hi> Secretary of State, commanding him to ſignifie to all whom it concern'd, that it was his Majeſties plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, no farther proſecution ſhould be made againſt them: and accordingly the Lord <hi>Conway</hi> gave notice hereof to the Chancellor, Treaſurer, to the Archbiſhops of <hi>Canterbury</hi> and <hi>York,</hi> and to all other chief Officers; principally requiring the Grand Treaſurer, to reſtore unto them all the monies which had been forced from them and payd into the Exchequer, with order not to do the like hereafter; and thus by obtaining their Promiſes Words, and Aſſurances, they had as much ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity as they could wiſh for, could they but be contented to exerciſe their Religion in private and without noyſe.</p>

                  <p>THe word of a King hath alwayes paſs'd for ſo ſacred, that ours have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſcrupel'd at the confirmation by Oath, of what they once gave upon their words. It was for that reaſon Saint <hi>Lewis</hi> would not ſwear in his own perſon to the League then made with <hi>Henry</hi> the third King of <hi>England,</hi> at the Camp neer St. <hi>Aubin,</hi> Anno 1231. but deſired it might ſuffice, if he cauſed it to be ſworn in his name and preſence, by the Prior of St. <hi>Martin</hi> the fields. Indeed, there being nothing more inviolable than the word of a Prince, it were an offence to doubt of his fidelity, or to deſire his ratification by Oath. The Genius of a Prince was heretofore held in ſuch veneration, that another ſwore for him; now to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire that he himſelf ſhould ſwear, were to decline that reſpect which is due unto him. However, the Infidelity of ſome hath made it a cuſtom, that all ſhould confirm their Treaties by Oath, when they are of any great importance; which Oath is the ſtricteſt tye which they can be bound in. The Laws look upon it for ſo venerable<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that they never permit it to be broken, what ever advantage hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen by it. Perjury is condemned as a double ſin, becauſe it not onely violateth that Religion which is due to God, who is invoked as a witneſs, but alſo Faith,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:56802:13"/>which is the moſt ſacred Bond of humane ſociety. Which Laws too, do oblige Princes much more then other men, to keep their Oaths, becauſe if they once for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit their reputation of being faithfull, they have not any thing left them which is conſiderable.</p>
                  <p>Chriſtians ought to be moſt preciſe in this point, if they would not be put to the bluſh, at the many examples of Pagans and Infidels. It is much to be lamented, that moſt men make no difference between deceit and diſſimulation; that they make no bones of infringing their Oaths, if they may but get any thing by it, they do much rather incline to follow the opinion of <hi>Marius,</hi> (though diſcommended by all the Sages of Antiquity) who thought the Art of well-lying, a great piece of vertue, and that it was an Index of a good Wit.) then that of the Common-wealth of <hi>Rome;</hi> which was ſo religiouſly faithfull for their words, that <hi>Ptolomey</hi> King of <hi>Egypt,</hi> left his young ſon their tuition and protection, without the leaſt apprehenſion of ſuſpition.

The League being ended, and the enemies of their Liberties, beginning to execute the deſigns which they had hatch'd for their ruine. The King who hath never leſſe inclination to aſſiſt his Allies, then to keep his own People in obedience, received them with all kind of favour, and forthwith gave them great hopes of obtaining their deſires. His Majeſty knew, that their Protection was Honourable, that there is nothing more glorious for a Soveraign then to ſhelter under his Power thoſe who are oppreſſed, that what Aſſiſtances he gives them, are moſt aſſured ſigns of his greatneſſe and generoſity, and withall that it was full of Juſtice. The Hiſtory of <hi>Holland</hi> had taught him, that the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> by their altering the Fundamental Laws, and oppreſſing the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Liberty of thoſe Countries, had thrown themſelves out of that Power which they once had over them, that the Hollander had reaſon ſufficient for their Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, to ſhake off the yoke of their obedience, by thoſe Laws which are as ancient as the quality of the Earl of <hi>Holland.</hi> An ancient ſaith, that Power is full of equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which is imployed in defence of the weak and feeble, and there is not any thing more juſt then to conſerve to ones Allies, thoſe Liberties which belong to them time out of mind, and by the Fundamental Laws of their Country. This in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular was ſo much the more aſſuredly juſt, for Princes who poſſeſſe a Country by Treaty with the People, and upon Conditions cannot infringe them, and not loſe their Authority; and eſpecially if they break Covenants, which doth abſolutely diſcharge ſuch Subjects from their obedience. The Hollanders were acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged for Free and Soveraign People, in the Treaty of the League made, <hi>Anno</hi> 1609. by the Kings of <hi>Spain,</hi> and Arch-Dukes of <hi>Flanders.</hi> And in the ſame quality have the Kings of <hi>England, De<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

A work of Juſtice ſo much the more certain, for that liberty hath been ever eſteemed a juſt cauſe for a War, every one concluding it more glorious to die then to live in ſervitude, from which his Birth and the Priviledges of his country have exempted him.</p>
                  <p>Beſides theſe important reaſons, the King was no leſſe informed of the eſpecial advantages which <hi>France</hi> might make, by defending of them, that it is above three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeore years together, that they have obliged not onely this State, but the moſt part
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:56802:14"/>of <hi>Europe</hi> to aſſiſt them, to ballance the Power of <hi>Spain,</hi> and ſo to find his Armies imployment in that Country, that his deſigns elſewhere might be fruſtrated; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, that it was now much more neceſſary, in regard the Gariſons were to be eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed in the Valtoline, and it would concern the State to make him ſome diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, that might entertain his Armies elſewhere; withall he found, that if he did aſſiſt <hi>Holland</hi> with theſe ſuccours, it would ingage them to do as much for him, when occaſion ſhould require it, which was no inconſiderable thing, as <hi>Henry</hi> the Great found by experience, when he was by them aſſiſted, againſt thoſe unjuſt oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which were formed by the League to thwart and croſs him: He himſelf too might fall into the ſame neceſſities, ſeeing the proſperity of Kingdomes, is like a Calm at Sea, which as it is often over-blown with ſtorms, ſo that too, is no leſs ſubject to interruption, by civil or forraign Wars. Theſe reaſons were indeed too too weighty to reject that people demands. And his Majeſty whoſe greateſt plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure conſiſts in doing ſuch things as might teſtifie both his Juſtice and Courage, gave all ſorts of Aſſurances to their Embaſſadours, of a ſtrong ſuccour, and thought good to make a Treaty for the renuing of the ancient Alliance.</p>
                  <p>His Majeſty gave the Cardinal power to conclude on the Conditions with them, and this great Miniſter, who had not a little fortified his Majeſty in that reſolution, having determined them, concluded it in the moneth of <hi>June</hi> at <hi>Compeign,</hi> by which he bound himſelf to deliver them by way of Loan, three Millions, and two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thouſand Livers in three years. On condition, that they ſhould re-imburſe them, three years after the War was ended. That they ſhould neither make Peace or League with any one what ever, without his advice and interpoſition. That if he had any occaſion of Ships of War, they ſhould furniſh him either for ſale or hire, at a reaſonable Price. That in caſe he himſelf were ingaged in any Wars, they ſhould repay him one half of the ſaid ſumms of money or aſſiſt him with Ships, according to the Proportion of that which was lent them. That they ſhould cauſe ſuch French Regiments as ſhould be entertained in <hi>Holland,</hi> to be conducted to <hi>Calais</hi> or <hi>Diepe.</hi> And thus in one and the ſame moneth, the Cardinal made his entrance upon the Adminiſtration very remarkable; by the reſolution of the Match with <hi>England,</hi> which ingaged the King of <hi>Great Brittain</hi> in his Majeſties intereſts, by the entertaining of the Spaniſh Forces in the Low Countries, by which he divert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them from aſſiſting the Valtolines ſo powerfully as otherwiſe they had done.</p>

This was ſo much the more to be feared, for that the greateſt misfortunes, and the moſt part of Civil Wars have no other begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, then miſunderſtandings of Princes againſt their Kings. The King thought good to impart it to the Cardinal, and having demanded his advice, of what was proper to be done in that occaſion, he did not at all diſſemble the danger, it would be, to permit this procedure of the Colonel: But the moderation of his ſpirit would not ſuffer him to carry him on to uſe ſuch violent remedies as others did adviſe him to; but on the contrary, he repreſented to him, that the Laws of Mercy obliged Kings to pardon the firſt faults of Grandees, provided that they would confeſſe their errors, eſpecially if there be a meanes to prevent any conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of danger: That the wiſeſt are ſometimes ſubject to miſcarriages, and are alſo capable to repent them; and afterwards to doe great ſervices: That the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration which many wiſe Princes have ſhewed towards ſuch offenders, hath made them more faithful and affectionate then thoſe who never committed any miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage at all: That this Repentance, was the more reaſonably to be hoped, from the Colonel <hi>d' Ornano,</hi> who till then had lived within thoſe limits, which ought to be obſerved by thoſe of his condition, that his Father had given him a good ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, by thoſe ſervices which he had done until his death: That he had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed forgot himſelf, but that his omiſſion might be remedied which ſeemed to deſerve pardon ſo much the more, in regard it is almoſt impoſſible for the greateſt part of Mankind not to forget themſelves, whenas fortune ſhall advance them into a place of Eminency: Moreover there was reaſon to hope, that the onely removing him for ſome time from the Monſieur would make him reaſſume his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer countenance, would make him ſenſible of his fault, and he himſelf would eaſily be induced to judge that this embroyl wherein he had ſuffered himſelf to be ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed would undoubtedly precipitate him into utter ruin, inſtead of raiſing him into a higher condition.</p>
                  <p>This counſel was accompanied with a much Prudence as Moderation; and the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:56802:15"/>King, who is ever carried of himſelf to follow the beſt advice, onely commanded the Collonel <hi>d' Ornano,</hi> to retire himſelf to his Government of <hi>Pont-Sainct-Eſprit,</hi> untill he were permitted to return to the Court, but the Collonel being confident, that there were nothing but ſurmiſes and conjectures againſt him, had the boldneſs to refuſe obedience to this order, perſwading the Monſieur to keep him near him, and to procure from the King by any extraordinary inſtances, that he might not be forced from the Court. The Monſieur beſeeched his Majeſties with all poſſible af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. However, the King gave him to underſtand, that his removal was very neceſſary to divert thoſe miſchiefs which he did not yet ſuſpect, eſpecially to preſerve that neer friendſhip, wherein they had alwaies lived: So he had nothing to reply, and his Maieſty to puniſh the inſolence, which had given ſo much boldneſs to the Collonel <hi>d' Ornano</hi> to reſiſt his Majeſties will, commanded him to be made Priſoner in the <hi>Baſtile,</hi> and ſhortly after in the Caſtle of <hi>Caen.</hi>

                  <p>Kings are ſo ſenſible in this particular, that it is not without trouble, that they permit Courtſhip to be uſed to their own Children: Thus, though <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedon,</hi> did intirely love <hi>Demetrius</hi> his ſon, yet he was much offended, when the Macedonians followed him in Troops, and ſhewed an earneſt deſire to inſinnuate themſelves into his good favour. But admit this jealouſie do not ſpring up, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſuch like actions ought not to be allowed, ſeeing infallibly it will breed broyls in the State.

                  <p>THoſe ſeveral agitations whereunto Fortune had expoſed the Colonel <hi>d' Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no,</hi> which ſometimes ſeemed to throw him headlong down, and then again to raiſe him up to great Honours, were not the onely marks of the Inconſtancy which that flattering Goddeſs made appear during this year: For after ſhe had raiſed up the Marquis <hi>de la Vieville</hi> juſt to the Adminiſtration, and to the Superin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance of the Treaſuries, ſhe was pleaſed ſo to caſt him down, that the King cauſed him to be arreſted at St. <hi>German en Laye</hi> about the beginning of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> and ſent Priſoner to the Caſtle of <hi>Amboyſe.</hi> To ſpeak truly, it was no ſuch great cauſe of admiration, ſeeing this Inconſtancy ſeems to have choſen Princes Courts for the place to exerciſe her power in, &amp; to have taken a great delight, as it were, to raiſe ſeveral men unto a high point of favour to expoſe them ſhortly after to the greater overthrows, every one had reaſon to attribute it to her moſt uſual conduct, which accuſtometh all men to this Law, that being once mounted to a certain degree of Honour, they muſt then of neceſſity fall back again, and that ſometimes with ſuch violence, that they fall into as great a number of miſeries as they formerly had of felicities. No one can be ignorant of this truth; but as Envy doth fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently aſperſe the principal Miniſters of a Prince, ſo ſhe gave the impudence to a Pen envenomed by the Spaniards, to write, that the Cardinal was the cauſe of it,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:56802:16"/>by reaſon of the fear he was in, leaſt the Marquis <hi>de la Vieville</hi> ſhould rob him of the Miniſterial honour.</p>
                  <p>But how little hath this Enemy of this King, as wel as of his Miniſters, proved his diſcourſe ſo contrary to the Truth? After the diſrepute which they in whoſe behalf he writ, had of the Marquis, they made no long uſe of him, without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſenſible that he was not an Inſtrument any way proper to raiſe their fortunes after the ruining of his own out of a Gallantry of Humour only. He went from St. <hi>Germans</hi> too with too much flowting, ever to invite his Majeſty by his ſervices, to make him the Miniſter of his Intentions. Beſides, could he be ſo extream ignorant of the Cardinals high and eminent Genius, in perſwading himſelf that the Cardinal could be any wayes ſuſpitious of the Marquis's undermining his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune? It were to perſwade the Sun that the leaſt Stars would obſcure his light; it were alſo to accuſe the King himſelf of great Imprudence, ſeeing it is to declare him incapable of diſtinguiſhing whether the Marquis of <hi>Vieville</hi> or the Cardinal were more proper for his Affairs. Certainly if the Sun diſcovers the deformity of a viſage which had layen hid during the night, and maketh the Stars, which twinkle in the dark, to withdraw themſelves upon his firſt approach. The Cardinal entering upon the Adminiſtration, and diſcovering to his Majeſty the incomparable diſcretion of his Counſels, was enough to detect the little ſufficiency of the Marquis, and to hide under the vailes of an obſcure darkneſs, thoſe advices which his vivacity and promptneſs of diſcourſe did make appear with ſome ſplendor, might give his Majeſty juſt cauſe to make no greater eſteem of him: And who ſo would accuſe him in this occaſion, muſt alſo reproach the Sun for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving too much light, and to call that in Great Perſons a Crime, which ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders them the more to be admired. Every one then knew the true cauſes of the Marquis's diſgraces, the King having given an Accompt of it to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the very day after his Arreſting; that he might be accuſed, as his Majeſty obſerved, to that Illuſtrious company for his evil conduct (which indeed was ſuch, that all men of any ſenſe thought him incapable of long ſubſiſting) That he had changed thoſe very reſolutions which were made in his Majeſties preſence, without acquainting him with it: That he had treated with Ambaſſadors reſident near him, contrary to his order: That he had oftentimes caſt that hatred which he had contracted, in exerciſing his paſſionate diſguſts againſt ſome particular perſons, upon his Majeſty; and that he had feigned ſeveral advices with deſign to induce him to be jealous of thoſe, in whom hee might put a moſt intire confidence, all all which is ſo true, that the King, that he might not take him unprovided, had of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten given him advice to alter his behaviour, and to become more exact in proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Orders, and more reſerved in his words, and in his procedure, as his Majeſty had ſignified in the ſame Letter.</p>
                  <p>After all which, his faults were ſo much the more known to the King, he having contracted the enmity of moſt part of the Grandees of the Court, by thoſe out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages wherewith he had provoked them, when they demanded thoſe gratuities which his Majeſty had granted to them, and by that exceſſive rigour wherewith he would cut off the Penſions and other Benefits, which they had formerly obtained of his Majeſty, as ſoon as ever he was entred upon the <hi>Treaſury.</hi> For they being once ſo provoked, wanted no addreſs to acquaint his Majeſty with it, and alſo to accuſe him of divers other unhandſome Carriages by ſeveral informers, who offered to prove that he had diverted great ſums from the Service of <hi>Spain,</hi> to his own profit and his Father in Laws, the Sieur <hi>de Beaumarchais,</hi> one of the Treaſurers; all which carried on his Majeſty to clap him up in Priſon.</p>

                  <p>NO one can doubt, but that a Miniſter who upon his firſt entrance into Affairs, finds them in diſorder, is obliged to apply neceſſary remedies to them; but the Laws of Prudence teach us, that it ought to be with moderation and affability,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:56802:16"/>without which, he doth like a raſh Phyſitian, who by giving his medicines in too great a proportion, and uſing too much rigour towards his Patient, doth ſo move and heat his natural temperature, that his ſickneſſe by it, is rather increaſed then di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhed. It is very dangerous to force men to paſs in an inſtant from one extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to another, and who ſo attempts it ſhall never eſcape the darts of Envy and Hatred, which will not onely render all his deſigns and labour to no purpoſe, but alſo expoſe him too to very great dangers. The firſt Actions of a Miniſter are they, which lay the Foundation of that Love or Hatred, which he ſhall afterwards reap from the people: a harſh rigorous procedure, can procure him nothing but ill will, and it is impoſſible for him to eſcape the doing many ill-offices neer this Prince; and though thoſe Cuſtomes and Uſes, which he would alter, be abuſes to the State; yet the Plurality of the People will hardly be conduced to think ſo when they have been accuſtomed to thoſe others a long time together; upon which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration it will be abſolutely neceſſary, to give them time to know better, and to diſuſe them by little and little. The wiſe <hi>Tatitus</hi> ſaith, he who finds an eſtate in diſorder, ſhall do much better at firſt daſh to ſubmit himſelf to the violence of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veterated Habit, and redreſs it afterwards with dexterity, rather then to fall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently aboard it, and to break all in peeces by a precipitated raſhneſs; and he fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſheth us with two examples, both very conſiderable for their contrariety: The firſt is <hi>Tiberius,</hi> who finding the People in a great licentiouſneſs, which the long Peace and meekneſs of the Emperour <hi>Auguſtus</hi> had brought them too, ſeemed at firſt not to regard it; his Prudence making him judge it improper, to treat them with ſeverity ſo ſoon, and that it was fitter for him to diſſemble with them a little while; which procedure of his gave an advantagious iſſue to whatſoever he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned: Whereas the Emperour <hi>Galba,</hi> though a better Prince then <hi>Tiberius,</hi> was as unfortunate as raſh, in that at his very firſt comming to the Crown, he attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with his utmoſt power, to redreſs thoſe diſ-orders which he found: He ſpilt the blood of ſuch as were Malefactors, with much ſeverity, and ſhewed himſelf to be very covetous; which behaviour of his rendred him ſo odious, that not many moneths after, he was ſlain in the midſt of <hi>Rome</hi> by his own Souldiers. It is with the People, as with a ſick man, who if in a Dropſie, he have not water given him to drink, though in it ſelf very hurtfull, throws himſelf into dangerous extremities, ſo they, if preſently reſtrained from thoſe Liberties and Freedomes which they had uſed to injoy, do run into Deſperation and Fury, and eagerly puſh at the deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of thoſe, whom they ſuppoſe Authors of the Alteration. Above all, it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary that a Miniſter, who would change the face of affair with time, ſhould uſe a great deal of ſweetneſſe, and a ſingular Lenity in it, becauſe inſolency and impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſneſſe are evil qualities, which do not at all conduce to the diſpatch of Affairs, and have no other operation, then to render them odious who uſe it. It makes the moſt juſtifiable remedies inſupportable; whereas courteſie and kindneſs, ſweetens any anguiſh, and makes it paſſe for very reaſonable. People do in ſome ſort, rather love diſorder in a Miniſter, provided he be tractable; then vertue, if he be hard of acceſs, rough, or inſolent. His commands will carry more Power with them, if they be accompanied with gentleneſs, then if ſet on with Force and Fury. For which reaſon I ſhould wiſh to him the temper of <hi>Ariſtides,</hi> who amongſt other good qualities that he had, was maſter of a great affability, which gain'd him the heart of all the World, ſo that afterwards he might do what he would himſelf; or the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity of <hi>Pompey,</hi> which was ſuch, that never any one went diſ-ſatisfied out of his Preſence; or the courteſie of <hi>Auguſtus</hi> whoſe Gates were ever open to all who would make addreſſes to him, and whoſe Petitions himſelf received with an admirable cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſie. It is to the examples of theſe wiſe men, he ought to conform himſelf, not with an eaſineſſe or too great a facility, that rather foments publick diſ-orders; but with the noble couragious ſweetneſs of <hi>Brutus,</hi> who according to <hi>Plutarch</hi> was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved of all People, for his natural goodneſs, though the intention of his Will was ſo upright, that he knew not what it was to ſtoop to the toleration of any diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders.</p>

                  <p>AFter the dis-favour of the Marqueſſe <hi>de la Vieville,</hi> his Majeſty being neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated to put into his place a ſuper-intendent; upon whoſe Prudence and Fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in the Adminiſtration of the Finances, he might ſafely rely, took adviſe of the Cardinal, well knowing that it is in vain to chooſe Officers if the are nor able well to execute their places, becauſe they are as it were the Soul and main-ſpring, by which he ſhall arrive to any good ſucceſſe.</p>
                  <p>This grand Miniſter then diſcourſing with his Majeſty upon this ſubject did not any longer conceal thoſe aggrievances, which ſeveral men did complain of in the Marqueſs <hi>de la Vieville,</hi> but thought it neceſſary to ſet two in his place. His rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon was, That the regulating of the Finances, wes much different from that of the Adminiſtration of the State; becauſe if the diviſion and envy which ſhould ariſe between two Miniſters, would draw on many inconveniences; yet the miſ-under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding which might make a ſeparation between two ſuper-intendents, would be the more advantagious, it being ſomewhat impoſſible, that two men, who are grown jealous of one another, ſhould divert the monies from the Treaſury, either of them fearing, leaſt his Fellow-brother ſhould detect him. His advice was, to chuſe two ſuch as were of great Honeſty, becauſe admit that one ſhould be corrupted in his Office, yet the other might ſtand firm. Beſides this, he adviſed him to caſt his eyes upon ſuch men, whoſe age and experience had made them of good capacities. He thought ancient men, and ſuch as were verſed in affairs, more proper then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, becauſe they are naturally inclined to more ſtayedneſſe, and have a greater reſpect and authority then young men to move the people, to ſubmit to thoſe Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, which ſhall be charged upon them: That the experience which they have by age, is the more needfull in affairs of concern, for without that experience Age doth rather make men unweildy and unapt for buſineſs; &amp; that this ſame experience, is known for one of the moſt ſolid Foundations of Wiſedom, of which no one can be more aſſured, then he who had often been deceived by Fortune, and who hath found to his coſt, that he ought to truſt but a few, and to be confident but of a little. Moreover, he propoſed too chuſe ſuch, as were neither too poor nor too rich; not very poor, fearing leaſt the power of diſpoſing the Treaſuries, might work upon their diſpoſitions, to miſ-imploy it to their own uſes, that they might raiſe themſelves out of their Poverty and Needineſſe; not very rich, leaſt the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and Authority which they poſſeſs might invite them to attempt whatever ſhould be ſuggeſted to them: Above all, he adviſed his Majeſty, not to place in ſuch Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of charge and truſt, any, but men of underſtanding, and ſuch as bad ſome go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment in their own affairs, there being no reaſon to intruſt the ſecond affairs of the Kingdome with people of but an indifferent Capacity; nor no hopes but of ruine and confuſion from ſuch whoſe life hath been diſorderly, and theſe are the chiefeſt good qualities of which a Super-intendent of the Finances ought to bee Maſter.</p>
                  <p>The King was not ignorant of theſe truths, but was glad to find them confirm'd to him, by the approbation of this grand Miniſter, and in proſecution of it, deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring him to name ſome men in particular, upon whom his Majeſty might caſt his eys, to fill up thoſe vacant Offices. He propoſed to him the Sieurs <hi>de Champigny,</hi> and <hi>de Marillac,</hi> as perſons in whom theſe qualities were eminent. Their Age and Experience had made them ripe for all ſorts of buſineſs; their Birth and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune had favourably imparted to them the gifts of Body and Mind. Laſtly, that moſt men gave them the Honour of eſteeming them both Valiant and Loyal; ſo his Majeſty, equally depending upon their reputation, and the Cardinals advice, honoured them with the Super-intendency. It cannot be denied, but that moſt of the Cardinals faithfull creatures, reflecting upon the little ſervice, which the Sieur
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:56802:17"/>
                     <hi>de Marillac,</hi> would have done the State in his own perſon, took occaſion to talk of it, that the ſhould be ſo preferred into affairs, without remembring thoſe extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagancies of his, during the Confederacy. But ſuch ought to conſider, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions ought not to be judged by the event, that the wiſeſt Counſels are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times attended with ill ſucceſs, as well as the moſt raſh and unadviſed attempts; and I ſhall tell them withall, that the Cardinal could hardly have imagined, how much it was to be wiſhed, that the Sieur <hi>de Marillac</hi> would have rebated ſome part of that unquiet and rebellious ſpirit of his, which he manifeſted during thoſe troubles, in relation to that reſervedneſs and moderation of which he was known to be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, when he had no other Office but that of the Requeſts and Councellour of State, which moderation of his, gave good cauſe to hope that his riper Age, had totally extinguiſhed that ſedicious fire which had almoſt conſumed him in his youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger days.</p>

A depraved Nature can beleeve no one, hardly himſelfe, whereas a vertuous oble diſpoſition honoureth ſuch as have the reputation of being fincere and Loyal with ſo much reſpect, that there need no great labour to make them be credited. I cannot more properly compare diſtruſt to any thing then to thoſe Poyſons which Phiſitians ſometimes uſe in their Medicines which adminiſtred with diſcretion and by weight do cure the moſt dangerous ſickneſses; whereas given in a little exceſs, they preſently kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo doth diſtruſt it is one of the beſt ſupports in a Miniſters conduct if he uſeth it mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derately, and on the other ſide, if too much made uſe of, it cauſeth a thouſand diſaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers both to the State and the Miniſter himſelf. Hee who is too diſtruſtful hath never any quiet; hee never looketh on any thing but it diſturbs him; no one cometh neere him, but hee ſuſpecteth it is with ſome ill deſign; if any one ſalute him with a little more then uſual reſpect, he preſently fancieth ſuch a one will cheat him, and vertue it ſelfe paſſeth for Hippocraſie in his opinion: And if by this means hee createth a Hell to himſelf, his ſuſpitions too are offenſive to all who have any manner of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation with him. I paſſe by thoſe inferiour perſons who do oftentimes render great ſervices to the State, and yet being denied the liberty of preſenting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, do at laſt hate the chief Miniſter, when they think themſelves diſ-reſpected. On the contrary, confidence puts the mind in great repoſe, gaines affection from all the world, induceth to imploy all ſuch as are able to do ſervice with Freedome, and many times maketh enemies themſelves to change their deſigns, and to proſecute inſtead of perſecuting his intereſts.</p>

He was removed by the Artifices of that Miniſter, to go ſpend the reſt of his days at his houſe of <hi>Sillery,</hi> that he might be eaſed of the trouble of the world. He made known both to his confident friends who viſited him, and to ſuch with whom he held an inter-courſe by Letters, that this change, wrought not upon his Conſtancy, and that his diſgrace did not at all alter the temper of his mind. He told them, that he had alwaies held it for a <hi>max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ime,</hi> to conſider Accidents by their true cauſe, which is the divine Providence, and ſeeing that no man ought to repine at that which he is forced to ſuffer, it were but reaſonable to conform our wills, to thoſe orders which are eſtabliſhed here upon earth; that he was not ignorant how that huge multitude which follows thoſe men who are in great places, doth not follow ſo much their perſons, as their fortunes; and that the ſolitude wherein he now was, made him find it ſo by experience, that he did not think he had the fewer friends in having ſo few Viſitants; that in fine, he in-joyed a great liberty, ſuch a one as he had never taſted in his moſt honourable im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments; that the ſweetneſſe which he found in it, invited him to lament their condition, who were ſtill bound to ſuch Slaveries: And that laſtly, the preferred his diſgrace before the higheſt dignty.</p>
                  <p>It was a middeſt ſuch prudent meditations, that he entertained himſelf near a whole year in great content from the Court, untill at laſt death came to put a peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od to his days, but left his Glory and Reputation freſh and alive in the memories of all, who knew him. After his death, his Majeſty gave the Chancellorſhip to Monſieur <hi>de Halligre,</hi> which was done by the Cardinals advice, who would by no means divert his Majeſty from raiſing of him unto this utmoſt pitch of Honour, which was uſually accorded unto ſuch as were Treaſurers at that time, and upon ſuch an occaſion; not that he was ignorant, that his Age rendered his Mind ſomewhat too weak for the weight of ſuch a charge; for the well performance of which, it was not enough, barely to have acquired the Ornaments of a ſingular Honeſty, which was however very commendable: But he could not reſolve to diſ-counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance him, it being his firſt entrance upon the Adminiſtration, and early dayes with him; ſo that he rather aimed to ſupply the others defects, by his own proper inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, which was able enough to defend the State from ſuffering, as to hinder him from his advancement; withall he hoped, that giving him often, the honour of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting him to be neer him, he might form him by his Counſels, and render him

                  <p>TO judge with certainty of the ability or inſufficiency of a man, for management of great affairs, is a thing very difficult. If it often happens that the moſt active ſouls do not well away with affairs of little concernment, it is not leſſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, to ſee ſome who make themſelves be admired as in indifferent imployments, who being raiſed to thoſe of a little higher degree, acquit themſelves very badly. To verifie which, <hi>Veſpaſian</hi> being over-ſeer of the Scavangers (before he came to the Empire) committed ſo many miſ-carriages, that the Emperour commanded his cloaths to be daubed all over with filth and dirt; but when Fortune had once raiſed him up to be Soveraign, he ſoon made it evident that the evil conduct, for which he was once blamed, proceeded from nothing but to ſhew that he was not born for love and mean actions. Men of great merit behave themſelves ſo negligently in ſmall, low imployments, that they give but a ſlender character of their abilities: On the other ſide, ſome have attained to a great reputation, in the diſcharging of ſmall affairs, and in proſecution of time being advanced to thoſe of greater weight, have found their ruine and confuſion in them. <hi>Galba</hi> may ſerve for an example of it, ſeeing before he was Emperour, he ſhewed ſo much Prudence in the diſpatching thoſe affairs which were committed to him, that every one conceived a very great eſteem of him, but being come to the Empire, he ſoon loſt it. If any one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand a reaſon of it, I ſuppoſe there is none but this; that as there ought to be a proportion between Cauſes and Effects, that they may operate within the Sphere of their power, ſo men ought to be adopted to charges in imployments, conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to their capacities and ſufficiencies; for that mens minds have certain bounds preſcribed to them, within the limits of which they are able to acquit themſelves with credit and applauſe; but if you advance them above, or depreſſe them below thoſe Spheres, they ſhew nothing but debilities and miſ-carriages. It was in this reſpect that <hi>Tacitus</hi> ſpeaks of <hi>Poppeus Sabinus,</hi> when he ſaid that he was ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly capable of thoſe imployments which were intruſted with him, but not of any higher. <hi>Titus Livy</hi> was not much out of the way too, when ſpeaking of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctatorſhip of <hi>Lucius Quintius Cicinnatus,</hi> he ſaid, that he had a courage equal to his charge, but not great enough to be General of the Army. Now in this incer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty, it ſhould ſeem to reliſh ſomewhat of injuſtice; peradventure too of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudence in a Chiefe Miniſter, to oppoſe the advancement of a man whom hee finds in imployment, and in the reputation of an honeſt integrity. It would reliſh, as I ſaid, of Injuſtice; becauſe his integrity and conduct, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, repreſent him for deſerving, and of imprudence too, becauſe vertue having the property of pulling down a hatred upon thoſe who oppreſſe it, it will certainly gain him the diſ-eſteem and diſ-affection of the people, ſhould he have hindred the t'others good fortune; beſides the nobleſt glory of a powerfull man conſiſts in being able to hurt, but at that ſame times to do moſt good to all men, eſpecially to thoſe who are vertuous. A man may eaſily be perſwaded that a Miniſter is vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, if he favours perſons of merit; and on the contrary, that he hath none but wicked deſigns, if he bring them into diſgrace, and of this he ought to take the greater conſideration upon his firſt entrance into the Government, becauſe he hath then the fitteſt opportunity of gaining upon the Peoples affections. <hi>Alexander</hi> knew of what concernment this particular was, when as a certain Lord of his Retinue complained that he gave no eſtate to any but perſons of great vertue, he was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered by him that he courted vertue, that ſhe her ſelf might pay him Homage over all the world.</p>

                  <p>THE Sieur <hi>de Marillac</hi> being honoured with the Super-intendency of the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, his unquiet ſpirit could not reſt long time without giving ſome object to his violence, the Finances he levelled at, and ſoon ſet them into ſuch confuſion, that they who behaved themſelves in their charges with the greateſt innocency, knew not where to hide their heads, It is true, that it was ſo much the more impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, to the good of the State, to repreſſe thoſe miſ-demeanours of many, who did openly ſquander away the Kings monies (which are the Sinnews both of the State and War) in that their ill management did neceſſitate the impoſing of new Taxes upon the People, in that they deprived particular men of ſuch ſumms as the King had granted them, not onely by way of gratification, but ſometimes of juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ice; and in that theſe unjuſt dealings gave means to many amongſt them, to make vaſt expences (a dangerous example to the publique) Yet ſhould hee have had for-born driving thoſe enquiries to that height which he did, and from infuſing into the Kings Soul ſuch a ſharpneſſe againſt them, that they all paſt for criminals indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently together in his Majeſties opinion.</p>
                  <p>The order which was followed was this, There was out of each Parliament one Councellour elected by them, who was reputed of extraordinary integrity to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med into a Court of Juſtice to them, were joyned certain Maſters of Requeſts, and two Preſidents of the Chamber of Accompts of <hi>Paris.</hi> Leave was given to all In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers, who would appear to give in their complaints againſt any Officer, or his Deputy, to the Procurator General, and there was ſo exact an Inquiſition made of all their deportments, that there was hardly one of them which did not run away to ſave themſelves from the ſtorm, which was falling down upon them. This Court continued from the end of <hi>October</hi> of this year, untill <hi>May</hi> in the year following; however it was with more threats then puniſhments, there being onely one put to death and ſome few in Effigie.</p>
                  <p>Monſieur the Cardinal did for ſome time behold this Tempeſt not giving way to his Prudence, to imploy that Benignity which is natural to him, towards the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derating his Majeſties juſt anger againſt them, as well to teſtifie upon his firſt entrance into the Adminiſtration, that it was not his intention to protect ſuch Malefactors; as alſo in regard it was neceſſary to terrifie and affright thoſe who were culpable, to the end they might for the future live with more Integrity and Juſtice. But in the end, ſeeing that the Principal Actors began to be touched to the quick, with an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion either of looſing their Honours, or their lives, and to compare them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in good earneſt, as much as could poſſibly be deſired, and withall to propoſe to his Majeſty in behalf of their perſons, to eſtabliſh ſuch orders in the Treaſuries, that it ſhould be impoſſible to divert any of the monies, or to defraud any perſons of ſuch ſums, as his Majeſty ſhould order to be payed unto them, he then became the Mediator of their Peace. It is true, it was not without making their Purſes pay for what was paſt, and ſetting up a better order for the future; for he brought them to condiſcend to give hit Majeſty ſeven Millions of Livers, and for the better kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping them in aw, it was ordained that every ten years a Court of Juſtice ſhould be ſet up, to inquire into their Actions, and he procured ſuch order to be eſtabliſhed in the Finances, that it was impoſſible for them to relapſe into their former errours. The King was ſo exaſperated againſt them, that it was no little difficulty to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade him to grant them that favour and grace which they begged for. But hee, knowing that the ways of reaſon, are thoſe by which his Majeſty is to be regained; he ſo followed them, that he ſoon re-placed him in his uſual moderateneſs of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and repreſenting to him, that it was Clemency was that virtue, which made Princes like unto the Divinity, that it could not but be glorious to pardon thoſe Officers, how culpable ſoever, that their offence was not more criminal then that of Rebellion, in which the <hi>major</hi> part of the French, had in ſeveral Wars hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore been imbroyled, that he would have ſo much the leſſe reaſon, ever to repent of
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:56802:19"/>the favour he ſhould do them; for that the late King his Father was highly praiſed for what he once ſaid to <hi>Monſieur du Mayne,</hi> after he had reduced him to his obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, <hi>viz.</hi> That the greateſt pleaſure he had in making a Peace, was the pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Rebels, That the Laws of the Romans ſeemed to invite him to pardon, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they had no other puniſhment then Baniſhment for Robbing of Publique Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury. That the end of a great Prince, is rather to make his Officers good, then to chaſtize them. That it was enough thus to puniſh their Purſes, ſo that they might both remember it, and ſuffer for it; that <hi>Veſpaſian</hi> had given him a very commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able example, when as he thought it more proper to preſerve then deſtroy Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuries, in ſaying he eſteemed them one of the ſtrongeſt props of an Empire, and that he looked upon them as a Meadow, which is mowed at ſome time or other, or as upon Spunges which are ſqueezed, when a man would get any thing out of them.</p>
                  <p>Theſe reaſons were ſo unanſwerable, and made ſuch an impreſſion upon the Kings mind, that following the inſtincts of his natural Bounty, he reſolved to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don them. Accordingly, he Repealed the Chamber of Juſtice, and accorded to them the favour which they deſired, and they eſtabliſhed ſuch Orders and Rules, which have tied up thoſe who were moſt wedded to their own intereſts, to live very ſtayedly.</p>

                  <p>IT is no new thing to ſee the Publick Exchequer ill governed. The Treaſury was common amongſt the Greeks, as <hi>Polybius</hi> and <hi>Chiriſophus,</hi> in <hi>Zenophon</hi> witneſſe, the latter of which reproacheth them with it, that there was hardly a man amongſt them of any mark, who might not be reproved for it. <hi>Ariſtides</hi> general Treaſurer of <hi>Athons,</hi> manifeſted publickly, that all thoſe who had managed the Treaſury of that Republick, not onely in his time, but before, had robbed them of a good quantity, not ſo much as excepting <hi>Themiſtocles. Gylippus,</hi> did divert a great part of thoſe Riches; which <hi>Lyſander</hi> had hid by a Slaves means of his, under the Tyles of his houſe. When he ſayd, if one ſhould look in ſuch a place, he might find good ſtore of Owls; meaning Gold and Silver, upon which the Grecians ſtamped an Owl, by reaſon of the Athenians, which was accordingly ſifted out, and deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the hands of the <hi>Ephores,</hi> who puniſhed him very ſeverely for it. For the ſame fault amongſt the Romans, was <hi>Sylla</hi> accuſed by <hi>Conſorinus,</hi> who grounded his indictment upon this, That he having but little wealth left by his Father, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that he was forced to lodge in a hired houſe, and was now become exceſſively rich. It would be eaſie to produce many of the like examples, not but there have been in all ages, honeſt, upright men, in whoſe hands the Publick Treaſuries have been regulated, with much fidelitie, and who have not deſerved leſſe praiſe then <hi>Pericles,</hi> of whom <hi>Thucydides</hi> reports, that he had not increaſed by one onely dragm of Silver, the Eſtate which his father left him, notwithſtanding the great imployments he had in the Treaſuries. But I can tell you, there have been ſome Perſons in the Ages laſt paſt, who have made ſo little difficulty of diverting the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury, that they have gloried in being made rich by it.</p>
                  <p>If this Crime then be ſo ancient, the uſe of puniſhing them, being once convict is as old, the Grecian and Roman Laws aſſure us of it, in the examples of <hi>Gylippus, Liſander,</hi> and many others; but muſt he not needs be very imprudent, who would not puniſh them at all, ſeeing the defrauding of a Treaty, is a Poyſon, which depriveth the State of the uſe of her Sinews and Muſcles: And laſtly, which decays its vigour, that it is rendred uncapable of attempting any thing either great or glorious. <hi>Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſian,</hi> as <hi>Suetonius</hi> ſaith, inforced the Receivers of his Treaſury, to render an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt of what they received from their fathers, and to reſtore him the ſurpluſage, as if they had robbed him of it.</p>
                  <p>The Laws of <hi>France</hi> are more ſevere, and they have been often executed, againſt the greateſt of the Kingdome, amongſt others, Father <hi>de la Berche Engneraud de

                  <p>
                     <hi>Philip de Valois</hi> made an Aſſembly very remarkable, of the three States, in which it was reſolved to make the Treaſurers, render an accompt, and to intruſt the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal of the Publick Money, into the hands of the Eccleſiaſticks and Noble Men; who it was hoped, would manage them with more Fidelity.

                  <head>The Affairs of the <hi>Valtoline.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>AFter the declaring what Empires Death and Fortune exerciſed during this year in the State, the proſecution of Affairs ingageth me to inform you of what paſſed in the buſineſſe of the Valtoline; but that I may write it with more perſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuity. I think it neceſſary to take the riſe of this Affair, and to obſerve to you, that the Valtoline is a Country ſcituated at the foot of the Alps, not unlike a great Ditch, ſeparated by the high Mountains from the Griſons, and thoſe which are on the Coaſt of <hi>Italy.</hi> It is not of very large extent, not being above twenty leagues in length, and one in breadth, but is very fertile, and of great importance, ſerving as a Gate to the Spaniards and Venetians, to bring Forces out of <hi>Germany</hi> into <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> as well to defend as to increaſe their States. The <hi>Venetians</hi> were not ignorant of it, when they were imbroyled with Pope <hi>Paul</hi> the fifth, <hi>Anno</hi> 1603. they made a League with the Griſons who are natural Lords of it, to have free paſſage through it, as their occaſions ſhould require, though <hi>France</hi> had the onely Power to diſpoſe of it, according to the Treaty made with them by <hi>Lewis</hi> the 12th. and renewed by <hi>Henry</hi> the Great, <hi>Anno</hi> 1602. during the time of his own life, the life of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent King, and eight years after his deceaſe. Which Alliance with them, gives great offence to the Spaniards, which cauſed them to make another League with the Griſons, to whom the ſame Paſſages were aſſured, for the ſafeguard of <hi>Milan:</hi> However after a long Treaty made in the year, 1631. theſe two new Alliances were turned topſie turvey, and that of <hi>France</hi> re-ſetled; it is true, it was not for any long time, becauſe the Venetians having been at variance, with the Arch-Duke <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> and the houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> ſent Secretary <hi>Patavin</hi> to the Griſons, who contracted another league with them, which made the Spaniards re-aſſume thoſe former intelligences of theirs, inſomuch that there were two parties formed amongſt them; that of <hi>Plauta</hi> for the Spaniards, and that of <hi>Deſlia</hi> for the Venetians, which kindled ſuch a fire as could not be extinguiſhed to this preſent day. The difference was ſuch, that from the year 1617, to the year 1621. there were nine inſurrections among them, in which ſometimes one party, ſometimes another had the better of it. At laſt the Valtolines, annoyed by the Injuſtices and Extorſions, which the Proteſtant Griſons uſed over them, and otherwhiles pretending that they would a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boliſh the Catholick Religion from amongſt them, they made a general revolt, and at the perſwaſion of the Governour of <hi>Milan,</hi> maſſacred all the Proteſtants they met with. In <hi>July</hi> 1620, the Griſons could eaſily have chaſtiſed them for this cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell act, whereas they to ſecure themſelves, from the revenge which they expected, had recourſe to the Governour of <hi>Milan,</hi> who glad at heart to make an advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage in this occaſion, was not backward in ſending them ſouldiers, and building them Forts in their Valley.</p>
                  <p>The King being then ingaged in re-taking thoſe Towns which the Hugonots had gotten into their poſſeſſion, could not ſuccour the Griſons with his Armies; but however he ſent the Marſhal <hi>de Baſſompiere,</hi> extraordinary Ambaſſadour into <hi>Spain,</hi> to require, and in his name to demand that the Valtoline might be reſtored, and all things re-placed into their former ſtate and condition. The Marſhal took extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:56802:20"/>paines to procure it, and at laſt obtained it, and accordingly it was ſigned at a Treaty in <hi>Madrid,</hi> in <hi>May</hi> 1621. on condition that certain great Liberties might be accorded to the Catholiques there, and with a Proviſo, that the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons of the <hi>Swiſſes</hi> and the <hi>Valtolines</hi> ſhould incline the <hi>Griſons</hi> to conſent to what had been agreed upon.</p>
                  <p>But the <hi>Spaniards</hi> proceeding with little Faith to execute the Treaty, procured the Catholique Cantons, by their mony, to deny their conſents, which one thing being deficient, they would put off the whole execution of the Treaty; and moreover, made one at <hi>Milan,</hi> with the Deputies of the <hi>Griſons,</hi> and two o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, with the ſame <hi>Griſons</hi> and the Archduke <hi>Leopold,</hi> by which they got great advantages in thoſe Countries, and ſo kept to themſelves the power of paſſing any Forces thorough that Country.</p>
                  <p>This Procedure made the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> very jealous, as alſo the Princes of <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taly</hi> and <hi>Germany,</hi> which were not intereſſed in the deſigns of the Houſe of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtria,</hi> and having made their complaints to his Majeſty, his Majeſty, who is as much concern'd for them as the <hi>Griſons,</hi> concluded a Treaty of Alliance with the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> and Republique of <hi>Venice,</hi> in <hi>February</hi> 1623, for the executing the Treaty at <hi>Madrid,</hi> and the re-eſtabliſhing the <hi>Griſons</hi> in their Soveraignty of the <hi>Valtoline.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This League made the King of <hi>Spain</hi> ſuſpect, that they began to ſmel the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurpation which he had made, ſo that ghueſſing he ſhould find a hard task to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>he offered the King to put all thoſe Forts which the Governour of <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan</hi> had built, in depoſit in Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the fifteenth's hands, and thoſe of the Holy Seat, to be by them kept until the concluſion of the Treaty, which ſhould be made to end all thoſe differences. The King could hardly be drawn to agree to to the depoſit, both becauſe there was no need of any other Treaty then that of <hi>Madrid,</hi> as alſo by reaſon of the liberty of paſſages which the <hi>Spaniard</hi> would keep. However, his Majeſty being preſſed unto it by the Pope, conſented to it, upon condition that all thoſe Forts ſhould be demoliſhed within three months, during which time, the Articles of Accommodation ſhould be agreed on at <hi>Rome.</hi> The Commander of <hi>Sylleri</hi> was then Ambaſſador at <hi>Rome</hi> for <hi>France,</hi> and the Duke <hi>de Paſtrane</hi> had the ſame charge from <hi>Spain,</hi> and both having received power from their Maſters to treat and negotiate this Affair, there were divers Propoſals made; <hi>France</hi> never made any difficulty of according to any thing which might contribute to the exerciſe of the Catholique Religion in the <hi>Valto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line,</hi> or for ſecurity of all ſuch as made profeſſion thereof: But they would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver agree to thoſe demands which the <hi>Spaniards</hi> made concerning the having of Paſſages, with ſo much peremptorineſs. During which time Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the fifteenth dyed, and <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban</hi> the eighth being ſet in his place, after his firſt entrance upon the Popedom, propoſed new Articles of Accommodation, which compri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed as much as could be of advantage for the Church and Catholiques, which were readily accepted to by <hi>France,</hi> but as ſtoutly rejected by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> for that it did not grant to them the enjoyment of the Paſſages.</p>
                  <p>Their Refuſal ſurpriſed the Pope, but he being made by ſome of their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, who had repreſented to him, that thoſe Paſſages were the leaſt recompence which they could pretend to, in lieu of many Millions which they had expended for the defence of the Catholique Religion in the <hi>Valtoline.</hi> His Holyneſs propoſed to them, to grant them paſſage for their Souldiers into <hi>Germany</hi> and <hi>Flanders,</hi> in behalf of the War which they ſhould make againſt the Heretiques, but upon no other occaſion whatſoever.

It is true, the Commander of <hi>Sylleris</hi> had been ſurpriſed by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and had conſented to thoſe Articles wherein the demand of thoſe Paſſages was included, but however had not ſigned them, and the King diſowned them, and declared, that he having done it contrary to his order, he was not bound to ratifie it, and principally ſeeing he himſelf too, had not aſſented to them, but after he had underſtood of the diſgraces which had befallen the Chancellor his Brother, and the <hi>Sieur de Piſieux</hi> his Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew.</p>

                  <p>IT is very dangerous for a Prince to ſit ſtill, and ſee another invade his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours for certain Paſſages or Countries, which may lay his States, as it were, hedge by hedge, and eſpecially if thoſe places may ſerve for a In-let, or Door to give ſuccours to his own Allies, ſuch a thing were to give him leave to turn his weakneſs into ſtrength, for that united States are ſtronger then when diſunited. Great Rivers whilſt they are in ſmall Brooks, are fordable by every one, and are not feared at all, until all their waters run in the ſame channel; and divided E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates may eaſily be ſurpriſed, whereas if united, they are capable of giving jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie to their neighbours, as alſo to make attempts upon them.</p>
                  <p>It is a common ſaying in Philoſophy, <hi>Vis unita fortior,</hi> united Power is much ſtronger than when divided into ſeveral particulars. <hi>Sertorius</hi> evinced this to his Army for a Truth by a witty Invention; he commanded two Souldiers to pull off a Horſes tayl, both which he choſe for the purpoſe, of a different humour and ſtrength; the one of them weak, but ingenious, the other ſtrong, but raſh; the latter, in obedience to <hi>Sertorius</hi> command, took a whole handful of the Horſes tayle, and tugging with all his force, could not pull it off; the ſecond took a quite contrary way, he pull'd them off hair by hair, until he quite made an end; whence <hi>Sertorius</hi> took an occaſion to exhort his Souldiers never to ſeparate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves either in a Fight, or upon a March, he told them, they had ſeen, that u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited Forces are hard to be vanquiſhed, but eaſily overcome if diſunited. If this reaſon be ſufficient to warrant a man, from permitting an Invaſion in any Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, it is the more neceſſary to be proſecuted, when it ſerves for a mutual paſſage for <hi>France</hi> to aſſiſt its Allies, and to receive ſuccour from them, for that theſe Paſſages are of as great concernment as the Allies themſelves, for once being loſt. Allies can neither give or receive any ſuccours at all. That Prince who ſuffers them to be uſurped, expoſeth his ancient Allies to be made a prey, and cuts off one of his own armes, wherewith he might have defended him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
                  <p>For this very reaſon it is, that our Kings having often diſcoved the <hi>Spaniards</hi> deſigns of invading <hi>Savoy,</hi> have preſently been on foot to defend it, as the uſual Gate of Communication between <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> which once loſt, they knew that all the Princes of <hi>Italy</hi> would quickly be reduced to the mercy of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> ſeeing they could not be aſſiſted by <hi>France,</hi> which hath ever been their Protectrix, as alſo, that <hi>France,</hi> if occaſion were, could not receive any ſuccours from them.</p>

                  <p>THe Commander <hi>de Syllery</hi> being thus ſurpriſed, the King was obliged to call him home, and to ſend in his place <hi>Monſieur de Bethune,</hi> a man of great judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and reputation, to whom he gave expreſſe order, to declare very reſolutely to the Pope, that he would never conſent that the Spaniards ſhould have paſſage in the <hi>Valtoline,</hi> and to beſeech him in his Majeſties name, that he would uſe his authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to inforce the execution of the Treaty of <hi>Madrid,</hi> that according to the rules of Juſtice, the Griſons might be reſtored to that which had been uſurped from them, both in the <hi>Valtoline,</hi> as alſo in the rights of the League at <hi>Caddee.</hi> A little after his departure, his Majeſty received advice, that the reſolution of denying thoſe paſſages, was approved of at <hi>Rome,</hi> ſo he diſpatched one to him upon the way, that he might every day be more reſolute, and that hee publiſh it aloud to all the world, to ſtop the Spaniards mouths, who made people beleeve, that at laſt wee ſhould give ground and accord it to them.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Sieur de Bethune</hi> being arrived at <hi>Rome,</hi> acquitted himſelf ſo worthily of that which was give him in charge, that the Pope no more doubting of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties reſolution, told him, he would forthwith diſcharge himſelf of the Forts in the <hi>Valtoline.</hi> The <hi>Sieur de Bethune,</hi> was for the preſent ſatisfied with it, and gave notice of it to the King, But upon receiving his Majeſties further pleaſure upon that particular, he very briskly told his Holineſs, it would be a thing of very ill conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, to deliver them into the Spaniards power, ſeeing if it were once done, a breach between the two Crowns were not to be avoided. That it were no leſſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Intereſt of Religion, to ſurrender them to the Griſons who were Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, and that the beſt expedient which could be taken was (but by the By he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed it onely as from himſelf) either to raze them, as by the Treaty of <hi>Madrid</hi> was agreed on, or to leave them to the <hi>Valtolines</hi> themſelves, ſeeing there might be an eaſier agreement made with them, then with any others. The Pope found him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſo intangled, that he knew not what to reſolve, ſo that the buſineſſe, had been Wyer-drawn into a great length of time and delays, if he had not been preſsed by thoſe Proteſtations, which were ſeveral times repreſented to him: That the King his Maſter, after he had imployed all the means of a Treaty to no purpoſe, would have recourſe to thoſe to his Arms, without any more ado, to obtain that by force, which was denied to the juſtice of his Reaſons.</p>
                  <p>His Holineſs being thus hard put to it, would willingly have delivered up the Forts into the hands of the Valtolines; but one thing which hindred him was, he would be re-imburſed of thoſe Charges which he had expended, for their preſervation du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the depoſit. The Spaniards offering to give him ſatisfaction in it, did invite him to deliver them up to them. But the <hi>Sieur de Bethune,</hi> making him the ſame proffers from the King, did ſo puzzle him, that afterwards he could not deliver up the Forts to one, without offending the t'other, and without making a breach be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them. Now to diſ-ingage himſelf from theſe broyls, he made divers Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals, but all tending to delays, the <hi>Sieur de Bethune,</hi> acquainting the King there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, received expreſs Order, not to conſent to any expedient of that nature, and rather to preſs his Holineſs, to leave the Fort in the Spaniards hands, then to uſe any longer delays; becauſe his Majeſty was fully reſolved, not to let the year paſs away without ſomewhat of Action, and in caſe he could get no other determinate reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that he ſhould write to the Marqueſs <hi>Coeuures,</hi> preſently to enter with an Army upon the <hi>Valtoline.</hi>

                  <p>IT is uſual with Princes, who are Mediators of Peace between other Soveraigns, to amuſe thoſe Embaſſadours which are with them upon that accompt, with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers new Propoſals, which themſelves judge not to be feaſible. When they find things hard to be concluded on, they hope, that time may in fine produce ſome a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable overture, both to one and t'other, which may induce them to lay down their Arms; or elſe, they indeavour by this means to give time to him, whom they would incline to favour, to draw his forces together, and put himſelf into a poſture of defence. In ſuch Encounters an Embaſſadour ought to be both Prudent and Stout: Prudent he ought to be, that he may dive into the qualities and conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of ſuch Propoſitions as ſhall be made unto him, either to reject them, if in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenient, or to make appear that it is on good grounds, he doth not accept of them. Couragious too he ought to be, to maintain his Maſters Intereſts, with ſtrong Reaſons and Generoſity, without fear of being importunate, and without making a ſcruple of ſpeaking out, when need requires. If he diſcovers any weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, ir-reſolution and dulneſs of Soul, if he be ſlow in finding out expedients, or do not well diſcuſs ſuch propoſitions as are made to him, he cannot eſcape the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the World; on the contrary he will gain the more honour, if by his viva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, addreſs, and vigour, he ſhall effect with eaſe, thoſe affairs, which otherwiſe would be intricate and Thorny, and free his Country from Wars, and allay the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſperations of his enemies; and in fine, reduce the moſt obſtinate to be governed by the Rules of Reaſon.

                     </gap>ll be an act of Prudence in him, not to bewray the leaſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions of fear, to ſee his Maſter ingaged in a War, which if he ſhould, his enemies would ſoon make advantage of it; on the contrary, he ought rather to imitate the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of <hi>Quintus Fabius,</hi> who being ſent from the Romans to the Carthaginians, preſently told them, that he ſhould be moſt glad, if there might be any expedient found out for an accommodation, which would be for the good of both parties, if it might not be, he there preſented them too Gages, one of Peace and t'other of War, that they might chuſe which they pleaſed. He will be much blamed, who ſuffers himſelf to be amuſed with frivolous Propoſals, made onely to gain time; as it befell the Embaſſadours of <hi>Dyoniſius</hi> the Tyrant, who being ſent to the Syracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian to treat a Peace, were entertained by <hi>Dion</hi> General of their Army, with ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ſpecious Propoſitions but without any concluſion, until he had re-edified a good part of the Wall, by which the Town ſhould have been taken, and then had no other anſwer but this, That the Syracuſians could make no Peace with <hi>Dyoniſius,</hi> unleſs hee renounced the Soveraignty, and content himſelf with ſome meaner Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours. An Embaſſadour ought ſometimes to excite and preſs that Prince with whom he treats, when he cannot draw any reaſon from him, and if his Inſtances ſhall be looked upon as importunities by him; yet his maſter will eſteem them for marks of his Courage and Fidelity; however, ſuch remembrances ought to be with reſpective honour due to Perſons of Quality. For being a little toucht, they rouze up themſelves, but if provoked by offences, they run into extremities. An Embaſſadour of <hi>Genoa,</hi> did heretofore ſuggeſt as much to <hi>Galeas</hi> Duke of <hi>Milan,</hi> by a witty invention, when he was ſo obſtinate that he could not procure ſo much as Audience from him; he preſented him (among other things) a Veſſel, on which he had laid a Baſil-plant, the Duke was ſurprized at it, and knowing not what it ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, ſent to know the Embaſsadours meaning, the Embaſſadour willingly waited on him, and told him, that the Genoveſes were as all other Princes, like that Plant, which if a little rubbed in the hand, ſends forth a very ſweet ſmell, but if preſſed untill the juyce come out, it breeds Scorpions; thus he obtained much of what he deſired by this means. To be ſhort, Kings are of that humour, that if an Embaſſadour ſhould be ſo inconſiderate, as to domineer and uſe outragious ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches; it would onely breed Scorpions, that is Bloody Wars, by provoking of their anger; but if he be Prudent and Generous, to preſs with dexterity and moderation,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:56802:22"/>they will become ſenſible, and be reduced in fine to whatſoever ſhall reaſonably be deſired from them.</p>

                  <head>The Marqueſs <hi>de Coevures,</hi> is ſent to the Cantons of the <hi>Swiſſes,</hi> for the Griſons affairs.</head>
                  <p>THE orders in this negotiation, were executed with a great deal of Prudence and Courage; however all would not do, to obtain any reaſon from the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards, who never want opportunities, of making advantages out of the rediouſneſs of a Treaty. The Cardinal who knew of old, all their tricks, adviſed the King, not to ſtand dallying upon the means of a Treaty, as formerly; but forthwith to make uſe of his Arms, to reduce them to terms of Juſtice.</p>
                  <p>This way of proceeding, was much different from thoſe which had heretofore been uſed; the intent of it being, to raiſe up the Renown and Reputation of the French, amongſt ſtrangers to make no difficulty of taking up their Arms, to obſtruct the enterprizes of the houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> rather then to ſuffer their allies to be lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger oppreſsed; the Ruine of whom, would undoubtedly ſhake the Foundations of this Empire it ſelf. This Generous reſentment, was concurrent with his Majeſties inclination, ſo that he reſolved to ſend the Marqueſs <hi>de Coevures</hi> into <hi>Swizzerland,</hi> at the ſame time that the <hi>Sieur de Bethune</hi> was diſpatched towards <hi>Rome.</hi> There were two Inſtructions delivered to him; by the firſt, he was ordered to re-unite all the Swiſſe Cantons, with his Majeſty, to diſpoſe the Catholicks, to give their aſſent to the Treaty of <hi>Madrid;</hi> and to eſpy if in this re-union, there might not ſome way be found out, for to re-place the Griſons into the Soveraignty of the Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonine.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond was to be kept private, if the firſt took effect, elſe he was comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to incourage the Griſons to riſe, who ſhould receive aſſiſtance from his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty of ſuch Troops as ſhould be neceſſary, according to ſuch orders, as ſhould be received; there went with the Marqueſs, all the Griſons Captains, who were at that time in the Swiſs Regiment, who were thought moſt able to be made uſe of in the Valtoline, to fiſh out any thing which might be thought proper to be known, and to give intelligence to the Marqueſs of thoſe Countries. But that which was the beſt guide of all, was to ſee ſix hundred and ſixty thouſand Livres, paſs in a Convoy to be diſtributed ſome part amongſt the Swiſses, upon whoſe natures nothing hath ſo great an influence as mony; and the other part upon the firſt expences of the war, if there ſhould be any occaſion to begin it.</p>
                  <p>Upon his comming into Swiſserland, he found the Spaniards had made ſtrong Parties there, ſo that it was impoſſible for him, on the ſudden, to open the peoples eyes, that they might ſee how they precipitated themſelves into their own ruine. He imployed the <hi>Sieurs de Meſnim, &amp; du Meſnil,</hi> to negotiate with them in ſmal Aſſemblies; and preſently after his arrival, he went to <hi>Baden,</hi> but it was with lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ſucceſs untill the General meeting in <hi>Auguſt</hi> at <hi>Souleur.</hi> In the <hi>ixterim,</hi> he laboured very diligently to gain the Principal Captains, either by diſtributing the Kings money amongſt them, or by inſtilling ſuch other reaſons as might be able to move them. To the Catholicks he gave aſſurances, that his Majeſty did not inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſs himſelf for the re-ſtating the Griſons in the government of the Valtoline, but withall neceſſary conditions, for the exerciſe of the Catholick Religion, which made thoſe ſuſpicions which had been infuſed by the Spaniards to vaniſh. As for the Intereſt of the Church, and the good of their State, it was evidently demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated to them, that the loſſe of the Valtoline, would preſently be followed, by that of the three Griſons, which were inleagued together, and of which the Arch-Duke <hi>Leopold</hi> had already gotten a good part, That after the diſ-uniting of thoſe confederates, the Spaniard being maſter of the Paſſages, would not much trouble himſelf about thoſe little Cantons, which brought into them a great profit, and made them upon that ſcore very conſiderable. In brief, that it would quickly be eaſie for to invade their Country, and that he would the ſooner attempt it, for
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:56802:23"/>that he did not want any pretenſions, to intitle himſelf to the Maſtery of it. Theſe important reaſons, ſtrenthened with the payment of their Penſions, did ſo ſhake ſome of the Cantons, that thoſe of <hi>Berne</hi> and <hi>Zurich</hi> did firſt conſent, that there ſhould be ſouldiers levied for the King, and ſuch Proviſions of Ammunition, as every place ſhould require. But the Martqueſs chief endeavour was, at the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly at <hi>Souleur,</hi> where he ſhewed a Maſter-peece of Prudence, ſpeaking very highly of his Maſters name and ſuccours, and making uſe of the mony which he had brought with him, both together ſerved him to good purpoſe for obtaining of them, if not all, yet the moſt part of his deſires. The Catholicks accorded to ratifie the Treaty of <hi>Madrid,</hi> declaring however, that they did not intend to become bound to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the Valtoline by force. Then he got ſuch aſſurances as himſelf liked from thoſe of <hi>Berue</hi> and <hi>Zurich,</hi> for the Levies of thoſe Souldiers, which they had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed; and withall, got it to be approved by all the Cantons, onely that of <hi>Sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leur</hi> excepted, which by the means of <hi>Ladnoyer Rool's</hi> Faction, refuſed to declare it ſelf. It is true the Catholicks conſented to it, but upon condition onely it were for <hi>France,</hi> but there was a little more then ſo intended in it, for the Marqueſs demanded them for the ſervice of his Maſter, and of his Allies, without openly declaring that it was for the Griſons.</p>
                  <p>In Proſecution of time, and not hoping to procure any greater aſſiſtance, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to prepare all things to enter with an Army upon the Valtoline; but however it was, after he had informed his Majeſty of the condition of affairs amongſt the Gri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, where the <hi>Sieur de Land<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

Princes are capable of being ingaged upon divers conſiderations, either for the love which they bear to their Allies, or out of a ſenſe of honour which they are commonly touched with; or out of an apprehenſion of what may follow; or out of ſuch jealouſie as a puiſſant Neighbour may oblige them to have, or by neerneſſe of blood, or by the compaſſion which they have of others miſeries, and the Ambition to become Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tectors of their States. But Republicks are not touched with any of theſe conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations. All ſuch as are called to a Common Councel, think of nothing but their own particular Intereſt, and they imagine that whatſoever hinders the injoyment of their Revenue, or ſtops their Commerce, or their Labors, as War is a greater and more conſiderable evil then any others, which you can make them ſenſible of, and they can be drawn to nothing, but in caſe of abſolute deſperate extremity. Not but that there may be amongſt the people ſome Souls and Courages more daring then others but as moſt voices carries it, not their merit who adviſe it, ſo they are no more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded then Reaſon is, when as a multitude of different Paſſions, entertain the Will upon ſome pernicions object. It is to no purpoſe for a man, to attempt to ſhew them any conſequences which may happen in future for their ſpirits, have not a thing ſo noble as to look further then the time preſent, they are ſenſible of nothing but what is beaten into them, and they will much ſooner be perſwaded to beleeve that Fortune, who they thinks diſpoſeth of all humane affairs; becauſe themſelves want wit to govern them, will defend them from thoſe evils which they are threatned with, then be induced to take their own defences by Force of Amrs. Moreover, their cloſer covetous homou, abhominates any thoughts of expences, without which War cannot be maintained, and the noiſe of Guns and Drums onely, do ſo beat their Imagination, that if perchance they hear talk of a Siege or a Battel; poor ouls it quite skareth them out of their little wits. It were to be wiſhed they had ſmore heart and foreſight upon ſuch occaſions, for the length of time, which they

Beſides Count <hi>Mansfield</hi> who was then in <hi>France,</hi> offered to maintain an Army of 25000 foot, and 7000 horſe, under the Prince Palatines name, they paying him three hundred and ſixty thouſand Livres a moneth, to invade the Countries of the houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force them to a reſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The Cardinal repreſented to the Embaſſadours, that theſe Propoſals could not be but glorious, ſeeing the end of them was, to aſſiſt a Prince their Ally, and one deſpoyled of his eſtates; but moreover, very advantagious, becauſe proſecuting thoſe deſigns, they ſhould ſo divert the Armies of <hi>Spain,</hi> that they would never be able to addreſs themſelves to recover the <hi>Valtoline.</hi> This was unanimouſly agreed upon amongſt them, and in fine reſolved, that each of them ſhould contribute to the payment of thoſe 360000 Livres a moneth, <hi>viz.</hi> the King 180000. <hi>Venice</hi> 120000
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:56802:24"/>and <hi>Savoy</hi> 60000. It true, commonwelths do hardly reſolve on great enter prizes, eſpecially when there is a neceſſity of great expence.

                  <p>THough moſt Leagues which are made between Princes upon any deſign, are blamed by many, by reaſon of the ſhort continuance of them, as alſo of the little ſucceſſe which uſually hath attended them; yet they are not onely profitable on many occaſions, but alſo very neceſſary. Defenſive Leagues ought to be ſo much the more eſteemed; becauſe (as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaith) no Country is able to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt of its own proper force. And offenſive too are not leſs conſiderable; ſeeing they give means to Princes, to make ſuch Conqueſts, as without them they durſt not attempt. The firſt of theſe Truths may be authorized by the example of the <hi>Samnites,</hi> who reſiſted the Romans by their own proper ſtrenth, as they told <hi>Hannibal.</hi> as long as they were able to defend themſelves; but in proceſs of time, finding themſelves too weak, they aſſociated themſelves with King <hi>Pyrrhus,</hi> and to make way for the t'other. It is not moſt certain that the aſſociation of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Princes, gave them the means to carry away from the Turks, a moſt ſignal Victory in the Battel of <hi>Lepanto,</hi> which neither of them in particular could with reaſon hope for. It is true, the effects of Leagues, have not been alwaies over happy, becauſe ſeveral Princes making them for different intereſts, eaſily break them as ſoon as they have gotten their pretenſions, be it by force or compoſition. But the diſgraces of this kind, ought to be laid upon the right horſe, that is, upon the Imprudence and want of fore-ſight of thoſe who have managed them, not on the Leagues themſelves. It is not enough to contract them, but they ought to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted with favourable Conditions, and with Perſons from whom aſſiſtance may be had; and who, if they ſhould ſlip their necks out of the Collar, might not do us any diſpleaſure in it. They are very neceſſary with the neighbouring Princes, upon a place, which is deſigned to be aſſaulted, either in relation to Paſſages, or in reſpect of having from them Ammunitions, both of War, and neceſſary victuals, as there ſhall be occaſion. <hi>Hannibal</hi> knew this full well, when as he was upon his expedition into <hi>Italy,</hi> and made a League with the French and Spaniard; he took Hoſtages of them, and for better aſſurance left Gariſons in many of their ſtrong Holds. The Romans did the ſame, when they made war upon the Lacedemonians, by making a League with <hi>Ptolomy</hi> King of <hi>Egypt,</hi> without whoſe aſſiſtance that would have had ſomewhat to do to have paſſed on. Beſides when there is cauſe of ſuſpicion of their fidelity, it is neceſſary either to take ſome Perſons or Places of them, by way of Hoſtage; to the end, that their intereſt to perſerve them, may compel them to continue firm in their firſt reſolutions. If many of our Kings who have made expedition into <hi>Italy,</hi> had taken ſuch a courſe as this, were it onely in point of Paſſages, we had not ſeen them expoſed to ſo many dangers, nor indeed to ſo many diſgraces; yet in caſe by their receding they cannot cauſe any great incoveniences, there will not then be ſo abſolute a neceſſity of ſuch ſecurity and aſſurances: However, as it ought to be taken for granted, that they will ſtart aſide. in caſe the enemy give them ſatisfaction, to their intereſts, ſo there ought ſtill to bee
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:56802:24"/>Forces ready which may clap in upon them, and ſupply their deficiencies. It is a trouble to ſee them break their words, yet a Prince ſhall reap this profit from a League, to make it ſerve to give a happy beginning to an enterpriſe, by means of ſuch aſſiſting forces as may be drawn from it, and by dividing expence between them, which elſe muſt be undergone by one alone. It will not be preſently fit to defie them for that would be a means to make them take to the other part, but it will be needfull to have an eye upon it, and to be prepared for the worſt. Moreover, it is profitable to make Leagues, not onely with States, but with Princes and their Succeſſors, and to contract them with greater certainty, then <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth King of <hi>England</hi> did, who having recourſe to one of our Kings, after he had been deſpoyled of his Kingdome, had not other anſwer, but that the League was made with the King of <hi>England</hi> and his State, and that he being no longer King of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, France</hi> could not without breaking the Laws of Alliances, imploy their Arms againſt him, who was preſent Maſter of the Crown. To be ſhort, it is good to be carefull that the divers conſtructions which may be made, may not ſerve for a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text for them who would fall off. There muſt not be ſo much as the leaſt ſtarting hole left, for them to creep out, or to break their words, eſpecially if they make any accompt of their reputation, which is inſeparable from their fidelity, for with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out that they will perchance hardly reſolve to run Counter.</p>

                  <p>AT the ſame time, that the Kings orders were delivered to the Marqueſs <hi>de Coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vures,</hi> he received a diſpatch from the <hi>Sieur de Bethune;</hi> which told him, that he deſpaired of getting any reaſon from the enemy, by thoſe ways which he had till then tried, ſo that now he muſt have recourſe to <hi>Noſtre Dame de Frappe Fort;</hi> who as ſoon as he had received this piece of Rallary, he reſolved forthwith to take the field, concluding there was no reaſon any longer to defer it, and that if he could ſurprize the places unexpectedly, without giving them leave to provide themſelves, he ſhould ſtrike a great ſtroke in the buſineſſe without any great trouble. He had long before given order to 3 Swiſs, and 3 Griſons Collonels, to raiſe each of them a Regiment of a 1000 men, ſo that he had nothing elſe to do, but to ſend them word to be ready; on the other ſide, the Reſidents of <hi>Venice</hi> and <hi>Savoy,</hi> being come to him, they had agreed upon all things together: The <hi>Sieur de Meſnil,</hi> had order to make a Magazine of Ammunition at <hi>Zurich;</hi> for the Swiſſes and Griſons forces, and the Reſident of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>enice,</hi> undertook that the Common-wealth ſhould make another at <hi>Bergamo,</hi> for ſuch forces as ſhould march into the Republick; that which was moſt troubleſome, was there being a neceſſity of diſcovering the deſign to ſeveral perſons, it would be impoſſible to keep it from being known, and to hide their intentions of the time when they would enter upon the Valtoline. The Popes <hi>Nuntio,</hi> called <hi>Scapy,</hi> and the Marqueſſe <hi>d' Ogliani</hi> the Spaniſh Embaſſadour had notice of it, who made ſtrong indeavours to pervent any Levies amongſt the Swiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, or the marching of any Troops which the King ſhould ſend; but all would not ſerve the Levy could not be obſtructed, for the Cantons of <hi>Berne</hi> and <hi>Zurich</hi> where they were to be made, had given too particular an aſſurance of it; by means of the money, and the promiſes which were made them, that they ſhould be ſeconded with a puiſſant ſuccour, againſt any who ſhould attempt any thing againſt them up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that accompt. But their Contrivances and Cabals were ſo powerfull, that the Catholick Cantons reſolved to ſtop their Paſſages upon them; ſo the Marqueſſe was forced to his ſhifts, that his Majeſties Commands might not be ineffectual. His re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy was to cauſe his Horſe to march four by four (that is all ſuch as were ſent him from <hi>Breſſe</hi>) and to ſecure the Canton of <hi>Bern,</hi> for the conduct of <hi>Vaubecourt</hi>'s Regiment; ſeeming after he was once entred, as if he would force his way either by Fair or Foul means, to the Griſons. It was enough that theſe Cantons were by
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:56802:25"/>ſeveral Treaties bound to open their Paſſages to his Majeſties Forces, upon ſo juſt an occaſion as this was, and it made no great matter whether they refuſed it or not, ſeeing if they ſhould, they might be forced to it, without breaking the Laws of Equity. Thus he, being well informed of the reſolution which the <hi>Nuntio</hi> and the Marqueſs <hi>de Ogliani,</hi> had induced them to take, reſolved not to demand it, untill he were upon the very point of paſſing; becauſe they ſhould be better adviſed, then to deny him, when they find him in a condition not to be hindred, they not having the leaſt time to prepare themſelves againſt it,</p>
                  <p>All things being thus in a readineſſe for the beginning of the deſign, he ſent the <hi>Sieur de Lande</hi> to <hi>Zurich,</hi> to diſcourſe with the chief of the baniſhed Griſons, and to perſwade them to riſe, and then he commanded the <hi>Sieur de Harcourt</hi> Marſhal of the Field, and the <hi>Sieur du Lande</hi> to joyn with Collonel <hi>Salis,</hi> to enter into the Griſons to ſeize upon the Paſſages of <hi>Steitch,</hi> and <hi>Pont du Rhin,</hi> and there to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie themſelves, which was preſently diſpatched accordingly.

He was nimble enough to make them ſhake off the Yoke of the Arch-Duke <hi>Leopold</hi>'s Officers, who had uſurped upon them the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction, to make them renounce the Oath of Obedience, which was unjuſtly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted from them; to re-unite the three Confederate Griſons into their ancient Corporation, with thoſe Liberties and Soveraignties which they had injoyed before the late Wars; to eſtabliſh their ancient Seals of Leagues; to obtain a General Pardon for all their Rebellious Subjects in the <hi>Valtoline, Chiavennes,</hi> and <hi>Bormio,</hi> and to confirm the ancient Alliance with the Crown of <hi>France,</hi> except thoſe Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditary Countries of the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> and their Confederation with the Swiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.

                        </gap>re,</hi> the Garriſon in the Fort diſcovered them, and ſet in on fire, not ſtaying to expect their comming. Thence he paſſed to the Valley of <hi>Poſchain,</hi> and forced the Souldiers who were gotten into the Tower of <hi>Caſaccio</hi> (with a reſolution to ſtop the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of the Mountains) to diſ-lodge the next morning <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo that he became Maſter of the place. Theſe were the beginnings of this victory: But the people of the Country of <hi>Bormio,</hi> terrified at the ſight of the Kings Army, preſently waited up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, and ſent their Deputies to him to beſeech him in all their behalfs, that he would be pleaſed to receive them under his Majeſties Protection. They were recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved into his Favour, with confirmation of their ancient Liberties and Priviledges, and aſſurance of the onely exerciſe of the Catholick Religion; withall he left there ſome Companies in Garriſon, who were to keep the Paſſages. That which did trouble him amidſt this Proſperity was that he had onely 4000 men left; however his valour would not give way that he ſhould loſe the day after ſo fair an advantage, though he had no more Cannon, without which the Forts in the <hi>Valtoline</hi> ſeemed impregnable, yet hee reſolved to ſupply this defect by the Courage of his Souldier. <hi>Piautermala</hi> was the firſt place, which he met in his way, which was ſo
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:56802:25"/>fortified that he might have been ſtopped there, had but the ſouldiers within beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved themſelves as they ought; but he made his approaches ſo reſolutely, that the Souldiers ſeemed to be made all of Braſs, ſo little did they eſteem or care for the Musquet ſhot, which ſtrook ſuch a terrour into them, that they left the place, and gave him free liberty to enter, which he did the ſame day with moſt of his Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies in the <hi>Valtoline.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Marqueſs <hi>de Bagny</hi> General of the Popes Army, gave preſently an Alarum to all the Valley, who finding himſelf unable to make reſiſtance; eſpecially, ſeeing the Venetians joyned with him, ſent ſveral Propoſals of agreement. But the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs <hi>de Coeuvre</hi> gueſſing it was only to amuſe him, and give time to <hi>Serbelon</hi> Captain of the Spaniards to advance his Companies, preſently commanded Collonel <hi>Salis</hi> to make the approaches to the Town with his Regiment; during two days there paſt many skirmiſhes between them, the ſucceſs of which forced the Marqueſs <hi>de Bagni</hi> to retire into the Caſtle, but the Marqueſs <hi>de Coeuvre</hi> preſently entred the Town, and forthwith conſtrained him to render, though indeed upon honourable terms, granted in favour to the Pone, to whoſe Enſigns the King had commanded all ſort of reſpect and honour ſhould be paid.</p>
                  <p>The quick ſurrender of this place invited the Marqueſs <hi>de Coeuvre</hi> to proſecute his deſigns, and having ſent his forces toward <hi>Sondrio,</hi> the Inhabitants had forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with opened the Gates, if the Governour of the place had not oppoſed; though he too was not long before he delivered it up. For the Marqueſs having Planted thoſe Cannon which he had received from the Venetians, ſaluted the Caſtle with 40 or 50 Cannon ſhot, which diſ-mounted all their Guns, and hurt and killed ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of their Souldiers, and forced the Governour for to march out upon com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition.</p>
                  <p>Theſe were the principal Exployts of War, which the little ſeaſon of the year, and the Snows then falling, would permit him to do, but it was a ſure gage of the Conqueſt of all the <hi>Valtoline,</hi> which was taken (as I ſhall hereafter declare) in the 3. firſt moneths of the following year.</p>

                  <head>Politick Obſervation.</head>
                  <p>NO one but a great Captain knows how to manage an enterprize to advantage; It is an effect which proceeds not but from a Prudence raiſed above the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon pitch, and which is onely proper to an extraordinary courage. The order which ought to be obſerved in ſuch occaſions is, principally to conceal as much as poſſible may be, the real deſign under ſome imaginary apparencies and pretences, which may be thought ſpecious. It will be a difficult thing thus to do, in reſpect of thoſe many perſons, to whom there is a neceſſity of imparting it, to diſpoſe of things for action; however one may diſsemble the time and place of execution untill the very laſt, and admitting things begin to be ripe, it will nevertheleſs be expedient to do ſome ſuch things as may perſwade the world, that every thing will not be yet a while concluded on; and when it is, it muſt be given out to be in other places then thoſe which are deſigned to be aſsaulted. This will be a means to take thoſe places unprovided, and thoſe who keep them being unprepared for a defence, will be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to ſurrender. The Romans judged this thing to be of ſo great importance, that they conſecrated all their enterprizes to Silence; and in fine, there are few men who have been ſorry to have kept their deſigns private, but many who have received great loſſes by their making them publick. <hi>Perſeus</hi> King of <hi>Macedon,</hi> purpoſing to fall upon the Romans, had not diſcretion enough to keep his deſign private; ſo that the Senate hearing of it, gave ſuch effectual orders for the making a defence, that the Commonalty of <hi>Rome,</hi> did ſooner hear of the Victory againſt him, then of the beginning of the War. All ſuch as follow his Imprudent example, can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect no better a ſucceſs from Fortune; after this once done, he muſt go ſeek a new opportunity, and a favourable occaſion to put his reſolutions into actions: It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing moſt certain, that opportunities are the greateſt weights in affairs, and that
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:56802:26"/>from thence it is, that the good or ill ſucceſs moſt frequently doth depend. God hath choſen Times and Seaſons which are moſt proper, for that which he would bring to paſſe; and a wiſe man ſhall make no ſmall advantage by it, if he take time by the Fore-lock, for having once turned his back, it is impoſſible to effect any thing to advantage. If Trees put forth their Bloſſomes, either too ſoon, or too late, it is a great chance if there bee any fruit at all; juſt thus the good ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe of a buſineſs, is ſo reſtrained and dependant upon Opportunity and Time, that a few days will either make or mar the whole deſign. It was for this reaſon, that <hi>Julius Caeſar,</hi> as it is delivered by <hi>Suetonius</hi> did not ſo much look after thoſe times, in which he had reſolved to execute his deſigns, as after thoſe opportunities which Fortune ſhould preſent to him, his uſual courſe being to chuſe ſuch times as were the moſt dangerous, and when one would have imagined he would not have taken the Field. Place too, is not of leſſe conſequence then Time, experience frequently evidencing it for truth to ſuch as are in the Wars, if it be either in a March, in Quarters, or Battel, which are the thrre principal Actions of War. It was place which gave the Engliſh the advantage of getting a Victory againſt King <hi>John,</hi> and to take him Priſoner, which glory they had never got, had it not been for their ſeizing upon certain riſing grounds and Vineyards, which were near the place of the Battel. But when as time preſents a favourable occaſion and place too, then it is, that all expedition ought to be uſed, not to loſe them; for the delaying of a buſineſs Mines the moſt hopefull and glorious expectations and deſigns: whereas diligence gets a thouſand advantages and victories. Had the <hi>Sieur de Chaumont</hi> fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly marched on againſt <hi>Bolognia,</hi> he had certainly reduced the Pope to that extremity, that he muſt of neceſſity have made a Peace, there being but a very few people in the City; whereas going on but ſlowly towards the ſiege, he loſt the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity which Time had preſented to him.</p>
                  <p>It is neceſſary to accompany this Promptitude with vigour and courage, ſuch as may aſtoniſh an enemy, and ſurprize him; for though Fortune be a friend to the couragious and daring, yet all muſt make way and give place to the valour of him who attempts with reſolution; &amp; this vertue is known for one of the moſt aſſured be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings of a victory. To be ſhort, if a man hath made himſelf once Maſter of any place of Importance, he ought not to reſt there, but he muſt proſecute his advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, and improve it to the very utmoſt with vigour and ſtrength, that he may reap thoſe fruits which uſually attend ſuch actions. If the Chriſtians had done ſo, after the Battel of <hi>Lepanto,</hi> they had in reaſon reduced the Turk to ſtrange extremities, but their defect in that particular, gave him leiſure to recruit his forces, and to make himſelf preſently as ſtrong as ever.</p>

In order to this deſign, as ſoon as ever the <hi>Sieur de Soubize,</hi> heard that the Marqueſſe <hi>de Coevure</hi> was at it tooth and nayl with the Marqueſs <hi>de Bagny,</hi> he preſently put out to Sea, and diſpatched two ſmall Veſſels before him to <hi>Blavet,</hi> to underſtand the condition of the place, which they would find more liberty to effect, then thoſe who ſhould conduct them by pretending they came from a long voyage. But the night following, he comming thither about nine a clock, and upon the intelligence which they gave him, that it was very ill guarded, he marched into the Port with about a thouſand men, beſides the Seamen upon the Ships. There wanted nothing neceſſary for a ſurpriſe, he ſeized upon ſix ſhips, belonging to the King, and Duke of <hi>Nemours,</hi> and preſently after landed and took the Town, there remained no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the Fort which he did not get by a happy default of his Conduct; for had he forthwith aſſaulted it, it was ſo ſlenderly guarded, that he had entred without any reſiſtance, but he having firſt given the Allarum to the Town, he who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the Fort had the leiſure to put himſelf into a Poſture of defence, and to ſhut the Gate; but the <hi>Sieur de Soubize</hi> did not long keep the Town in his power; for the Duke of <hi>Vendoſm</hi> then Governour of <hi>Brittain,</hi> hearing of it, preſently ſent to all the Nobility of the Province, with order to bring all the men they could, every one of which came with great diligence. The Duke of <hi>Vendoſm</hi> comming Poſt, found that the <hi>Sieur de Querrollin</hi> entred into the Fort, with ſtore of Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, Victuals, and Ammunition.

For <hi>Proſpero Collonna,</hi> who commanded that Town, and making merry without the leaſt ſuſpicion, upon confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that the King was far enough off from him, was ſurpriſed by the <hi>Sieur de Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſſe,</hi> which he heard not of before he ſaw him in his Quarters. It is true, he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf might be excuſed, in regard his Sentinels were taken, and that ſome of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants held Intelligence with the <hi>Sieur de la Paliſſe,</hi> but however the whole miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune was laid in his diſh: though he was a brave Commander, yet he was much blamed, it being not permitted to a man of that condition to ſay, I did not think I was in any danger. For this very reaſon it was, that <hi>Iphicrates,</hi> one of the Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians moſt renowned Captains, would have his Army alwaies upon their guard, or in a poſture to fight, during times of Peace; in the ſame manner, as if in the heat of War; and he anſwered ſome who miſliked his curioſity, that one ought alwaies to ſuſpect who would not be ſurprized. Indeed vigilance is one of the moſt neceſſary qualities for a Governour of a Place, he ought to eſteem that the honour which he hath in commanding to be but a glorious ſervitude. That in Commanding all, he is bound to watch for all; that he remember Governments are called charges, and that the name of Charge which he hath, ought to teach him, that it is a burthen committed to his Prudence, and that the place which is intruſted with him, is not barely recommended to him, but he to the place, to be guarded and conſerved with his beſt care.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">E</seg>VERY one takes delight in the Spring time, to conſider the Face of the World, when as the hand of God guides the Sun a little nearer to us, to behold that fair Star, eſtabliſhing a ſerenity and calmneſſe in the ayr, before troubled with Tempeſts; to ſee the Earth repleniſhed with a thouſand Ornaments of Beauty before, languiſhing, and quite decayed by the bitterneſſe of Winter, and to view Plenty introduced in the room of Barrenneſſe, which the Hoar Froſts, and Snows had left behind them. But how much more delightfull was it to look upon <hi>France,</hi> preſently after it had pleaſed his Majeſty, to advance the Cardinal to the Government of Affairs, who like a Sun which ſhould be the greateſt inſtrument of his glory, began to re-aſſume his ancieat Splendour, and to diſpel by little and lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle thoſe cauſes of Civil Wars, which did every year renew themſelves in the State, to ſet bounds to the ambition of ſtrangers, and to eſtabliſh ſuch an order under the Kings authority, which is not onely the happieſt but moſt Illuſtrious of all other Kingdomes. The increaſe of glory, which his Majeſty every day gave to this Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter, did ſerve to augment his courage, and raiſed new lights in his Soul, ſubtilized his Prudence, and furniſhed him with occaſions, to demonſtrate to the World, that he was amongſt thoſe Miniſters of whom Hiſtory gives us ſuch commendations, to be as the Cedar amongſt the Hyſop. He could not be enough admired, ſeeing his whole life was nothing but a Publick imployment, and who abſolutely renouncing the idle voluptuouſneſſe of ſeveral other Favourites (who ſeem to think on no other thing then to indulge themſelves with thoſe favours which fortune preſents to them) had his mind without any intermiſſion ſtill affixed upon high deſigns tending to the glory and Grandure of his Maſter. He knew that immoderate unſeaſonable delights did rob Miniſters of State, of a thouſand fair opportunities. That it is
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:56802:27"/>impoſſible to ſerve the Publick, and injoy the pleaſures of this life, he made open profeſſion he had none but ſuch as were neceſſary for an honeſt diverſion, and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly if pleaſures could not bewitch him, intereſt nor profit could never Charm him, or get any power over his Will. Honour was the chief aim, which he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed in all his actions, which he ſought for in his Maſters glory, and he ſcorned all profit which did keep him off from it: But that, which from the beginning gave the greateſt admiration of all to his conduct was, that imitating that manner of opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting uſed by the Divinity, which is inviſible as his Eſſence. There were every day wondrous effects of his Prudence brought to light, before any reſolutions were heard of, or before any Orders taken were perceived; whereas before, there was not any thing concluded on, which did not make more noiſe then the effects. We ſhall proceed to conſider the particular in the Proceſſe of this Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and I ſhall ſatisfie my ſelf with laying down this poſitive ground. That the King having given him the Honour of all his Truſt, after he had known the eminen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of his <hi>Genius,</hi> the wiſedom of his Counſels, his fidelity not to be ſhaken, the dexteriouſneſs of his Conduct, which hath nothing parallel with it, he likewiſe total<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gave himſelf up to his Majeſty.</p>

                  <p>A Miniſter is obliged in the ſame manner, to make his Maſters greatneſſe, and that of the State his principal aim and end; he ought to remember that Kings are the lively Image of the Divinity. That then Miniſters are the Suns, which their Kings glory doth form for the good of their People. As God hath created that Star which over-rules the day, to ſhew us here beneath one Ray of his infinite Splendour, and to be the Authour of all thoſe bleſſings which are communicated to us here below; but ought he not to know before he attain the honour of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment whereunto he is arrived, that private Intereſt which doth ſerve to inrich Families, is the greateſt enemy of State in the Soul of a Miniſter, and that the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of a Kingdom ought to be done as the Tutillage of Orphans, which is granted not for the profit of the Guardian, but of thoſe perſons who are intruſted under his Tuition. Glory is the onely thing which is permitted him to aſpire to, and how can he hope to atchieve that, without tranſacting many things which may give a Reputation to his Maſter, and his own Miniſtration.

                  <p>
                     <hi>MOnſieur le Cardinal,</hi> knowing there was nothing more pernicious to Kingdomes then the want of Generoſity in Miniſters, who content themſelves by living in a lazy Peace; in which time, they give leave to ſtrangers, to increaſe their powers, and inſtead of cutting off the Cauſes, do onely skin over diſorders in the State, did not imagine it ſufficient to keep things in their former indifferency, but brought the King to apprehend great deſigns towards the procuring that ancient luſtre once a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to <hi>France,</hi> which it had in the beginning of its Empire. It is natural to a man to be more apprehenſive of thoſe dangers, which are neareſt, and as it were at hand upon him, then thoſe which are further off, though they be of a worſe conſequence, and at this paſſe had things been a long while together: Whereas the livelineſſe of
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:56802:28"/>the Cardinals Soul, which penetrates into the Ages to come, preſently diſcovered to his Majeſty the dangers of this nature, and made him apprehend the other the more eaſily, in regard his Majeſty was not ingaged in them, but onely by the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of thoſe who had the management of affairs. He made it quickly apparent to him, that they who ſhew themſelves ſo over-affectionate of Peace, do by little and little weaken and decay the State, without being aware of it, that they do mol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifie the Courages of the people by a ſloathfull repoſe, who by ſuch waies are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to the violences of ſtrangers, who have in the mean while exerciſed themſelves in Arms, and acquired force enough to make an attempt upon their neighbours. His Prudence imitated that of a diſcreet Phyſitian, who that he may perſwade his Patient to take ſuch things as may be convenient for his ſickneſſe, diſcourſeth to him the cauſes of his indiſpoſition, and then leaveth in to himſelf to judge if they be not proper for him.</p>
                  <p>Sir, ſaid he one day to his Majeſty in a particular Counſel, though a King who looks after nothing more then quiet, hath reaſon to beſtir himſelf when he finds his Miniſters, have brought his State into diſorder, becauſe there do every day ariſe to him new cauſes of diſcontent; yet he who ſeeks Glory ought not to be much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled at it, for that ſuch diſorders are the Ground-works upon which he may raiſe Trophies as marks of his Prudence and Generoſity; ſo your Majeſty need not be at all troubled for thoſe defects which have happened to your Eſtate, by the faults of thoſe whom your Majeſty hath imployed, who though they have been very affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate to your ſervice, have not however had Souls high enough to ſecond the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neroſity of your intentions. You may eaſily remedy all this, according as you have deſigned, there need only wel to know the Cauſes, and to apply ſuch remedies as may be agreeable, and the State will ſoon be in ſafety. Your Majeſty may command me any thing, for that I dedicate all my cares and all my indeavours to you, and I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not have any greater pleaſure, then to ſacrifice my life to your glory. And ſeeing you do me the honour to hear me diſcourſe, what I think to be moſt conſiderable in the State of Affairs. I ſhall not imagine my ſelf deceived if I ſhall tell you, that I have obſerved four things, which are the principal Cauſes of the weakneſſe and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ability of this State. The firſt is Forraign, and is nothing but the unbridled Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Spaniard, which makes him aſpire to the Monarchy of <hi>Europe,</hi> and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries him on to attempts upon your neighbouring States, which are as the out-skirts of the Kingdom, of which too he hopes to be one day Maſter, when he ſhall once have fortified himſelf upon the Frontiers, and made it deſtitute of ſuccours from its Allies. The other three are Domeſtick and at home, which ſerve for ſupports to all Rebellions and Revolts, which are like a Lyon bred up in the Kingdom, from whence nothing but miſ-fortunes can ariſe. The ſecond is, the exceſſive licenciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the Grandees, who do ſo much detract from your greatneſſe, by ſo much as they aſſume to themſelves more then they ought. The third is, the want of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciplin'd Troops who ſhould ever be on foot to oppoſe any enterprizes, which may be made againſt your Majeſty or your Allies. The fourth is, the want of conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Foundations in the Treaſury, to commence War upon occaſions, and to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply them as long as need ſhall require, I ſuppoſe that theſe are the original Sources, from whence do flow thoſe moſt dangerous miſ-fortunes which threaten <hi>France,</hi> and I imagine, if your Majeſty can but drayn them up, there is nothing more to fear: But on the contrary, all ſort of Proſperity and Glory to your Majeſties Crown much to be hoped for. The Attempt which the <hi>Sieur de Soubize</hi> made upon <hi>Bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vet,</hi> whileſt you were ſuccouring the Griſons, teſtified ſufficiently to your Majeſty that thoſe of their Party, would take all advantages, whenſoever your Forces ſhould be entertained in Forrrign parts. Thoſe Civil Wars, which the Princes do yearly renew, are thoſe which reduce your Majeſty to that weakneſſe, that you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not enterpriſe any thing abroad, nouriſhing the people in diſobedience, and giving means to the Grandees to partake of that honour with your Majeſty, which is one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly due to your Majeſties Scepter. In the ſame manner, the Uſurpations which the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> makes upon all the neighbours of <hi>France,</hi> will in fine give them
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:56802:28"/>means to uſurp that too; at leaſt ſtrenuouſly to attempt it, if your Majeſty maketh not timely oppoſition. In fine, the ſmall number of exerciſed Companies which are ordinarily on foot, and the ſmall Revenues in the Treaſury, do reduce your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty to that impotency of reſiſting ſtrangers abroad, or revolts at home. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore my chief advice is, that your Majeſty would give orders accordingly, and doe perſwade my ſelf you will ſoon ſee <hi>France</hi> change its countenance, and become as terrible to ſtrangers, as they have boldly offended it. This Counſel was a rare and ſtrange effect of his Prudence, which had diſcovered the true cauſes of <hi>France</hi> miſ-fortune. The King whoſe Soul is truly Royal, underſtood the ſageneſs of it, and having diſcourſed with him more at large, he reſolved to do accordingly, as we ſhall in the proſecution of this year.</p>

                  <p>THere is no one ſign more certain of a decaying State, then to ſee a Miniſter take no other care, then to make it ſubſiſt in a lazy Peace; for as States ruine themſelves by Wars raſhly undertaken, ſo they weaken themſelves by idleneſs. The greateſt Monarchs which are governed, without ſome high deſigns of inlarging themſelves, have never continued any long time without miſ-fortune, and that fair weather in which one ſtrives to keep them, is a Preſage of a dangerous turn. They who think on nothing but Peace, do by little and little unawares weaken them, and reduce them to impotencie, then ſoften and alter the temper of the couragious youth, by idleneſſe and want of Imployment, and by this means leave them for a Prey to Forrainers, who make themſelves ſtrong in Arms. Have not heretofore the Romans entertained Wars with their Enemies, knowing it to be needfull, to keep their Souldiers in breath, and to prevent growing ſloth which commonly breeds greater inconveniences with it, as alſo to vent the violent heats of the youth, who wanting imployments fly out into Rebellions and Civil Wars? It is ſaid to bee for this reaſon, that <hi>Edward</hi> the third, concluding the Treaty at <hi>Breſigni,</hi> would by no means comprehend the Treaty of <hi>Britain:</hi> And that <hi>Philip the Fair,</hi> made his Son <hi>John</hi> paſſe the Sea, that he might exerciſe his Arms. And who knoweth not, that if <hi>Henry</hi> the 2d. after the Peace <hi>Anno</hi> 1509. had imployed the French Arms abroad with ſtrangers, and oppoſed the Ambition of the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> by car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying his Armies out of <hi>France,</hi> the State had not been ſo afflicted with Civil Wars, which were upon the point of deſtroying it. It is not the Property of humane Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs to ſubſiſt long in the ſame degree, and who attempts ſo to conſerve it, deſigns an impoſſibility. States like thoſe who float upon the Waters, are in continual motion, and that Miniſter who hath not courage enough to raiſe a State to a higher Pitch of Glory, ſhall ſoon ſee it unravelled to nothing, when he would ſtop there, he will find it ſliding back. How can a Kingdom be kept in the ſame Condition, when all its neighbours have their Arms in their hands to go ſtill onwards; and ſeeing who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is content to ſee Forrainers increaſe their Power, ſhal ſoon ſee himſelf expoſed as a Prey to their Ambition. That Miniſter commits a great fault, who doth not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what is within the compaſſe of a State, ſeeing the Grandure of a Soveraign doth not onely conſiſt in his own Forces, but in the ruine of his enemies, and that his greateſt Power is in their greateſt weakneſſe. He ought not to be leſſe circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect in oppoſing any Forraign Uſurpation, then in eying his Maſters own ſubjects, and to keep them in obedience; who neglects one or t'other, ſhall ſoon ſee his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter expoſed to dangerous ſtorms, his authority deſpiſed, his power weakned by the ſtrength of ſtrangers, and his Kingdom aſſaulted by his enemies.</p>

He began this conqueſt about December in the laſt yeare, by the taking in of <hi>Planta, Mala</hi> and <hi>Tyran;</hi> and in the beginning of this he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted it, with ſo good ſucceſs, that every place was under his Majeſties obedience. After the reducing of <hi>Tiran,</hi> the Army drew towards <hi>Fondrio,</hi> which Town ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendred at firſt ſummons; but the Caſtle was fain to be battered with the Cannon, and a breach being made, they were obliged to force it, and carry it by aſſault, which they did with ſuch advantage, that there were only ſix of the Kings ſouldiers killed in it.</p>
                  <p>This ſtrook ſuch a terror into the Towns of <hi>Morbeigne, Travona</hi> and <hi>Orbino,</hi> that they ſent their Deputies, to render themſelves.

                  <p>HE who guides and directs great enterpriſes by his Councils, hath more ſhare in the glory of them, then they who execute and act them: It is Prudence which prevents an enemy, and taketh him at unawares, which diverts his Forces, and which knoweth how to fight and with ſuch advantage, that he is eaſily over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come. Hereupon <hi>Guicciardin</hi> ſaith in his Hiſtory, that the Prudence of one great Perſonage in a State, doeth more then all the Arms of the world; and Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phie teacheth us, that counſel is the moſt heavenly thing in all the world, that is it which renders men moſt like the Deity, whoſe property it is, as the Apoſtle ſaith, to do all things by the Counſel of his will. <hi>T. Livy</hi> being much of the ſame mind, ſaith, he hath often heard it reported among Souldiers, that who ſo knoweth beſt to command, deſerveth the firſt place, and who ſo to obey, the ſecond place: It can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be denied, but that there is as much need of executing, as giving good advices, becauſe if there were no one to put them into action, good Counſels would be to no purpoſe; but withal it muſt be concluded: That Counſel is ſo much the more excellent, in that it is the Child of the firſt and chiefeſt vertue, which is Prudence, whereas action the effect of it, is the Child only of force, which is much beneath it. The Sea-men indeed are in continual motion in their Ships to given order for ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral things, ſomtimes labouring to turn about their Sayles and Cords, and anon mounting up into the Bound-houſe to diſcrie the enemy, by and by to ſtop ſome leak in the Ship, where the water breaks in, and thus they have much more labour then the Pilot, whoſe mind though is in more agitation then their bodies, he working in his thoughts and judgment to keep all ſafe from the ſtorms and Rocks, to guide her home without being wraked, by thoſe operations of his, which are ſo much the more noble then theirs, by how much the acts of the Soul, ſurpaſſe thoſe of the Body. Who can without injuſtice, aſcribe more honour to thoſe who execute an enterpriſe, then to him who by the fulneſs of his Soul, firſt contrived it, digeſted it by his Prudence, found out means by the power of his judgment to ſet it on working, removed by his ingenuity all ſuch obſtacles as might oppotſe it, foreſaw all difficulties in it, and gave neceſſary orders for the carrying of it on, to a happy ſucceſſe? To ſpeak truly it cannot be, without robbing him, of that which juſtly belongs unto him.

                  <p>As ſoon as the Pope ſaw him, he told him, he could never have imagined, that the Arms of France would have fallen upon thoſe of the Church: but his Holineſs was not long unanſwered, the <hi>Sieur de Bethune</hi> telling him; That the King his Maſter was far from doing any ſuch thing whereof his Holineſs complained; that he was ſo backward from making war either upon the Church or his Holineſs in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, (whom he honoured with extraordinary reſpects) that on the contrary, he would employ his Arms and his utmoſt power to encreaſe their Glory and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity: That his Holineſs had no juſt cauſe to complain of a ſurpriſe, in regard he had been often times told, that in caſe the Spaniard would not yeeld to reaſon, the King his Maſter could not ſuffer the <hi>Griſon</hi> to be any longer deprived of their Forts, which lawfully belonged to them, that they could not be looked upon as any longer in his Holineſs power, ſeeing the depoſit was ended by thoſe ſeveral in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances and reaſons, which were remonſtrated to him; as by urging him that they might be re-delivered to the <hi>Valtolins,</hi> of the Juſtice of which his Holineſs himſelf was ſatisfied: and that afterwards the depoſit could not be any longer continued or prolonged in his Holineſs hands, by reaſon of that great difficulty, which the Spaniards made to aſſent to it; and ſeeing it was pretended, and that upon good reaſons, to re-take them from the Spaniards themſelves, who had found a trick to keep them by his Holineſs name, though hee was engaged to diſpoſſeſſe them of them, which being ſo, he ought to be ſo much the leſſe ſcruple at the King his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters proceedings, in regard he being only as an Umpire, who created between them in the quality of a Common Father, he could not with Juſtice keep them after the depoſit was expired, or give opportunity to the Spaniard to make advantages to the detriment and diſhonour of <hi>France.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe reaſons were ſo conſiderable, that the Pope could not but have reſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented, had he not been pre-poſſeſſed by the Spaniards; but however he made great complaints from time to time of the Kings proceedings. And the <hi>Sieur de Bethune</hi> returning not long after for a new Audience, did not find his Holineſs ſo moderate op civil to him as he had formerly uſed to be; but on the contrary, his Holineſs told him that the Cardinal <hi>Borgia</hi> had been with him, and touching upon the point of that little reſpect which had been ſhewed to his Army, hoped he might have induced to proceed againſt his Majeſty by was of cenſures, if he ſhould not with-draw his Army, and told him in a Spaniſh <hi>Rodomontado,</hi> that ſeeing he had permitted the French to take them upon one accompt, the Spaniards ſhould make them pay for it again, and ſhould do that which their Intereſts led them too, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being with-held by any conſideration; and in fine, proteſted to him, what ever inſtances were made to him that he would ſtill continue Neuter. But however as he was alwaies guided by the opinions of the Roman Doctors, who cannot indure there ſhould be any State affair, and not ſubject to his Will, he could not away with the taking of the Forts out of his hands by force. The <hi>Sieur de Bethune</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured by his Prudence to allay by little and little his heat, in evincing to him the Juſtice of his Majeſties reaſons; ſometimes by offering to him his Maſters Arms and Authority to inveſt him in the Dutche<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>IT hath been a common Cuſtome amongſt Princes in War, who ſhould not agree upon certain places, to put them in depoſit in a third perſons hands, and he who is the Depoſitary, ought to know that he hath no further Authority then to keep them, ſo long and upon conditions as are agreed upon between the Parties. Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity looked upon Depoſits as ſacred, and hath condemned thoſe who would uſurp them of Sacriledge, and one of the Depoſitary Laws, is declared to be, that who ſo refuſeth to render them, renders himſelf culpable of a great Injuſtice; becauſe he would uſurp againſt natural Reaſon, that which doth not at all belong to him. Amongſt the Grecians by the Laws of the Piſſeans; he, who denied the Depoſit was condemned to death; and <hi>Herodotus</hi> ſaith, that one <hi>Glaucus</hi> of <hi>Sparta</hi> having refuſed to reſtore a certain great ſum of money, which he had received of a <hi>Mileſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> conſulted the Oracle of <hi>Apollo,</hi> to know what he ſhould do in the buſineſſe; who was thus anſwered, That neither he nor his family, could any long time live up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the face of the earth, and that in effect they were already rooted out. Whence he concludeth, that it were beſt for him who hath a Depoſit, to deſign nothing but the making of reſtitution to him who ought to have it. And how well hath <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle</hi> deciphered the enormity of this Crime, when he ſaith, that that man who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes guilty of it, is much more unjuſt, then he who refuſeth to repay what was lent to him; becauſe he not onely violateth the Laws of Equity, as he doth who deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth what was lent to him; but alſo thoſe of friendſhip and fidelity; in conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of which the Depoſit was entruſted with him. I ſhall onely adde this, that the <hi>Depoſitiorium</hi> ought as well to be kept againſt thoſe who have intruſted it, he ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no right to become their Arbitrator, unleſſe they agree among themſelves; as to be really and without delay reſtored to them, when they ſhall have agreed upon condition between them. It is however, dangerous to chuſe a Perſon for a Depoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, who pretends a Superiority, or ſuch a one to whom one ows an extraordinary reſpect; becauſe as it is natural to a perſon of eminent dignity, to deſire that his advice might paſſe for a Law amongſt others, ſo it is hazardous, leaſt he pretend at laſt to become an Arbitrator. Whence it happens that if one of that Quality be choſen Depoſitary, it ought to be included in the Inſtrument, that he ſhall not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Arbitrator upon any difficulties that may ariſe. Above all this, one thing ought to be obſerved, when as the Pope is Depoſitary, as was practiſed when the Hoſtages in the Peace of <hi>Quieracco</hi> were intruſted with him; for that he in ſome ſort preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding a Power over Kings, he puts himſelf on as a common Father to judge of their differences, and withall may become Partial. Which being ſo, ſuch Princes who have choſen him for Depoſitary find themſelves impeded, by reaſon of the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties of getting reaſon from him by force without raiſing great broyls. There are but a few Princes of ſuch Fidelity, as that of the late King <hi>Henry</hi> the Great, who having leave to paſſe with thirty five thouſand men into <hi>Geneva,</hi> when he beſieged Fort <hi>St. Katharine,</hi> was ſolicited by ſome of his Captains to ſeize upon it, which they aſſured him was eaſily to be effected: He anſwered them, that it would be a moſt unjuſt action, to repay with Infidelity and Treachery, that Confidence and Truſt which they of the City had repoſed in him.</p>

That after all, the depoſit of thoſe Forts having only been for ſome time in the Pope hands; that whileſt there were means of accomodation, his Holineſs had no reaſon to complain, that he had been any way neglected, until the time which had been concluded on, had been expired, and that there were no hopes of an agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

                  <p>Theſe reaſons did evidence the integrity of the Kings actions, but however as his Majeſty had even ſhewed an extraordinary reſpect to the Holy Seat, and had then particular occaſion to make uſe of his Holineſs, for the obtaining of the diſpenſe for the match with <hi>England;</hi> he hearkened to the propoſals of the Cardinal <hi>Spada,</hi> and the Sieur <hi>Nary.</hi> The principal one, and upon which they moſt inſiſted, was an Article for ſuſpenſion of all acts of Hoſtility for two months, in the County of <hi>Chiavenne,</hi> in which time the Pope hoped that all things ſhould be accommodated, which being thought reaſonable, his Majeſty aſſented to it, and a Poſt was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently ſent to the Marquis <hi>de Coeuvres,</hi> to ſtop his farther proceedings.

                  <p>THE Affairs of Chriſtendome, were brought to that paſſe, that the two Crowns of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> did partake with the Intereſts of all other Princes. The one is bound to aſſiſt thoſe who are aſſaulted by t'other, and never did either of them attempt any thing which ought not by reaſon of State bee oppoſed by the t'other. If any one ask a reaſon hereof, it may be aſcribed to that emulation, which for above a hundred years hath been nouriſhed between them, ſo that neither can indure to ſee t'other increaſe his ſtrength or power; but to ſpeak more rightly, the reaſon is not one and the ſame between <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> for that either of them have their particular motives. The Spaniards like the Lacedemonians, have fixed the higheſt part of their Monarchy, not in that which is ſo much juſt as profitable for the inlarging of it, and conſequentially, they do eaſily violate all Rights and Juſtice, not reflecting, that the Common-wealth of the Lacedemonians, ſtood but a little while, it being ſetled upon ſo ruinous a Foundation, which was the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of their Power: Now with <hi>France</hi> it is quite otherwiſe, whoſe State be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing grounded upon Juſtice, doth not hurry them on to ſnatch up their Arms, but onely when their own defence or that of their Allies calls them to it. <hi>France</hi> hath no deſign but to preſerve it ſelf. <hi>Spain</hi> to increaſe it ſelf; <hi>France</hi> knoweth that ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty conſiſts in an equal ballancing of the Powers and ſtrengths of one another; and therefore it is, that <hi>France</hi> thinks her ſelf concern'd to obſtruct <hi>Spains</hi> growing too Potent, that he might not pretend to have any advantage over her, or her Allies. <hi>Spain</hi> on the other ſide, which hath long ſince formed and contrived a deſign of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it ſelf maſter of all <hi>Europe,</hi> conceiveth that there is wrong done him, if at any time <hi>France</hi> doth uphold her Allies in their juſt Poſſeſſions of their Eſtates, or take up Arms for their defence. Now to cement them in this diſpute, either of the two Crowns have their Allies, which are tied to them by ſeveral Bonds, that is, by diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent conſiderations <hi>France</hi> hath ſuch for her Allies, who ſuſpect the Power of <hi>Spain,</hi> and fear they ſhall be ſet upon by it: <hi>Spain</hi> hath others, who take part with the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts of the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> as iſſued from thence by ſome relation or other, and who are ſo far from <hi>France,</hi> that being not eaſily releeved, they are forced to keep all fair with them, and ſerve them in their deſigns, under the hopes, that by this means they may at leaſt procure <hi>that favour,</hi> which the <hi>Cyclop</hi> promiſed <hi>

But they went not away without a reply made to them, which was this, that the Catholicks both Spiritual and Temporal were never ill intreated, but when they contrived Combinations againſt the State, and when at any time there were any Proteſtants diſcovered to have a hand in any ſuch Cabals, they were equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly puniſhed with the reſt, without any reſpect had to their Religion.

But beſides, that this Propoſition was quite contrary to the truth, any one might eaſily know, that all Magiſtrates were indifferently choſen, either Catholicks or Hereticks, and that the exerciſe of Religion was abſolutely free; ſo that it was eaſie to anſwer them, that look upon thoſe Magiſtrates who were eſtabliſhed by Soveraigns (before any conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion could be had of what Religion they were) as Gods Lievtenants, and as the Apoſtles have taught us in their Holy Writ, and by their deeds, no one had any cauſe to complain of them at all; and thus all their Reaſons tended onely to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize peoples underſtandings, who were weak, but were diſcovered by all who had never ſo little underſtanding, to be contrivances forged in the fire of their Ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and indeed they themſelves diſcovered the Fraud, when as his Majeſty had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to them a moſt certain way for the aſſurance of Religion, and the Liberty of Catholicks, which they refuſed to accept of as to the <hi>Valtolines,</hi> or to lay down their Arms. And thus did they uſe their utmoſt indeavours to impede the late King <hi>Henry</hi> the Great, from obtaining his Abſolution from <hi>Rome,</hi> after his Converſion; though they every where Proclaimed, that the deſign of their Army in <hi>France,</hi> was onely to oblige him to become a Catholick.</p>

                  <p>IT hath been a uſual trick amongſt Ambitious men, to cover their deſigns with a cloak of Religion. So in the Heathens time, the Governours of the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> after they had, to no purpoſe, uſed their utmoſt indeavours, to hinder the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple from being elected into Offices, had at laſt their recourſe to Religion, and made them beleeve, that they having conſulted the Gods on that affair, were aſſured by
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:56802:33"/>them, that to communicate the Honours of the Republick to the Commonalty, were to prophane them; which being ſo, ſaith <hi>T. Livy,</hi> they forthwith deſired them, to recede from their pretentions, they feigning that they did it more in order to the Wil of the Gods, then of their own particular Intereſt. They well knew that the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were much addicted to Religion, and that it were ſo much the more eaſie to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe them upon that accompt, they having but a little knowledge of the Intereſt of Princes, the genuine reaſons of State, or of Religion it ſelf. Thus <hi>Ottho</hi> deſiring to get the Empire, was not contented by his pretending a great Treaſon, to ſpeak aloud his Affection to the Emperour <hi>Galba;</hi> but moreover told the Souldiers, the more to inflame them, that the Gods had declared to him by a remarkable Tempeſt, that his Adoption of <hi>Piſo</hi> was agreeable to them. After all, theſe fetches can one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſurprize ſilly people, they who are raiſed never ſo little above the ordinary ſort, are not ignorant that in point of State-diſſimulation, they ought more to regard their actions then their words. They learn by experience that ſuch kind of People, cannot be better compared then to Coyners of ſalfe money, who daub over their baſe allay, with Leaf Gold to hide the falſeneſſe of it. But Princes are now ſo accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed to ſee through their diſguiſes, that they are no more to be over-reached by them, and that without being ſtopped by the murmures of the people, they ſurceaſe not to take up Arms for the defence of their Allies.</p>

                  <p>THere need no more to proove, that Religion ſerved only as a mask to the Spaniards, to hide the injuſtice of their deſignes, then the bare intelligence which they had with the Heretiques of this Kingdom of <hi>France,</hi> which when undi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, hath been alwayes ſo potent, that it hath impeded the cours of their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings; and therfore it was, that they endeavoured to make parties amongſt them, as ſoon as ever they were drawn off towards the <hi>Valtoline.</hi> Thoſe great loſſes, which the Heretiques continually had had, for ſome preceding years in <hi>Bearn</hi> and <hi>Languedoc,</hi> alwayes kept them waking, eſpecially after the Peace of <hi>Montpellier,</hi> they well perceiving that thoſe ſmall Routs, which they had ſuffered, did threaten their party, with an utter deſtruction.</p>
                  <p>The Spaniards finding this diſpoſition amongſt them, were not backward to fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it, and laboured very much, to get the Sieurs de <hi>Soubize</hi> and <hi>Rohan,</hi> who were the only eminent perſons, to command their arms. Their deſigne took effect: Theſe two Brothers, being met at Caſtres, to conſider on ſuch Propoſitions, which were made to them on their behalf about Autumn in the foregoing year, reſolved to rayſe thoſe of their Party, the one by Sea at <hi>Guienne</hi> and the other in <hi>Languedoc.</hi> The attempt upon the Fort of <hi>Blavet</hi> otherwiſe <hi>Port St. Lewis</hi>) of which wee have already ſpoken, about the end of the laſt year was an effect of that reſolution, as alſo the endeavours of the Duke and Dutcheſſe of <hi>Rohan</hi> began about the ſame time in <hi>Languedoc</hi> to draw in more Towns into their party. This Dut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſſe, that ſhe might uſe her utmoſt dilligence, went moſt commenly by torch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in the night time in her Coach, which being in mourning, and withall furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed with eight black Horſes, ſerved rather to ſtrike a terror into the Country peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, (who were not uſed to ſee ſuch ſpectacles) then to gain any the chief men of their towns. But the Cardinals vigilance, was the principal obſtacle, which ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered all their Combinations void.

The Sieur de <hi>Soubize</hi> publiſhed a Manifeſt, which founded an Allarm to all the Hugonots party, and made them believe, that their utter ruine was concluded on in the Kings Counſel; That the loſſe of their Religion was inevitable, if they did not defend themſelves by Armes, and that the raiſing of Fort <hi>St. Lewis</hi> built by <hi>Rochel,</hi> was an aſſured ſigne of it, as alſo thoſe other ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages

It's true theſe reaſons were deduced with ſuch palliations, that moſt were taken with them, particularly becauſe the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> clapt into ſome Towns, certaine Gentlemen and Captains of his own Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, to encourage them, and to ſtir up the Popular Miniſters, who after this looked for nothing but when to riſe, not conſidering that the inſurrections which they were carried to, were contrived by the Spaniards, who make open profeſſion of being their ennemies, and who pretended not, to make uſe of them, but only to divert and draw off the Kings Arms from Italy.</p>

                  <p>NO one but a King ought to take up Arms: As formerly among the Romans, it only belonged to the Conſuls, who had the ſuperintendency of State, to open the two gates barred with Iron, and faſtned with a hundred hinges, which were opened in token of war: ſo when <hi>Caeſar</hi> began the war againſt the <hi>Gaules,</hi> it was <hi>Cato's</hi> advice to recal the Army into Italy, and to leave that great Captaine to his enemies, becauſe he had attempted it, without the command of the People and Senate. Seeing Kings are conſtituted by the hand of God, no one may riſe againſt them upon any cauſe whatever, without rendring themſelves guilty of Rebellion. True Religion it ſelf is not a ſufficient reaſon to raiſe a War, how much leſſe then may Hereſie make uſe of it as a Pretext? And thoſe Hereticks who make profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of following the Doctrines of the Holy Writ, have ill ſtudied it, if they have not obſerved this truth in it, that one is no leſſe obliged to obey Princes though In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels then others. God ſaith in <hi>Eſay,</hi> ſpeaking of <hi>Cyrus</hi> Monarch of the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Perſians,</hi> who had no knowledge of his holy name. I have called thee though thou haſt not known me, I have named thee by thy name, and have raiſed thee up to honour and power, though thou haſt had no knowledge of me; and I will, that both they of the Eaſt and Weſt ſhall know, that it is I who have eſtabliſhed thee, and that there is not any Governour upon the Earth, that hath not received his Power from me and my hand; and afterwards he addeth, that he hath anointed him and placed him on his right hand, that he might bring the Nations into Subjection, whoſe preſence abateth the hearts of other Kings, who breaketh the Gate of Braſs, and burſteth the Bars of Iron, to whom all things are manifeſt, and nothing is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed from him. Thus though <hi>Nebuchadonozer</hi> was a moſt deteſtable Tyrant, and the greateſt Infidel of all Princes that ever were.

Subjects have not by the Law of God, any other defence then flight.

It being thus manifeſtly neceſſary to oppoſe the progreſs of this ambitious deſign, it could not be better effected then by the aſſaulting of <hi>Genoa,</hi> which is the onely Port of entrance on this ſide of the Alps, which being ſhut up, and preventing his ingreſs on that ſide, he could hardly bring in any Troops at all, eſpecially if the Forts of the <hi>Valtoline</hi> were no longer in his poſſeſſion. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, the State of <hi>Genoa</hi> did not onely ſerve the Spaniards as an Inlet into <hi>Italy,</hi> but alſo to convey ſouldiers into <hi>Germany</hi> and the Low Countries, and for a Mine from whence they extracted good ſtore of mony, ſo that the depriving them of it would be no ſmall weakning to him: Theſe were the true reaſons which invited the King to this attempt which were ſo juſt, that it appeared lawfull, that State being the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Flower, which the negligence of ſome of our Kings have ſuffered to be pulled out of this Crown, and the Spaniard could have no more reaſon to complain of his Majeſties entring upon <hi>Genoa,</hi> which was under their Kings Protection, then the King of <hi>France</hi> had, to lament his ſeizure of the <hi>Valtoline,</hi> of which his Majeſty of <hi>France</hi> had had the Protection for many years together.

The Duke was the more inclined to it, ſeeing the injuries which the Genoeſes had done him but lately, were a juſt cauſe to begin a War.

The Ceſſation preſerved at that time the Forts in the <hi>Valtoline,</hi> and ingaged the Duke by ſo many Intereſts and concerns in the War, that it was impoſſible for him to fall off or be unfaithfull, and not find his own ruine in it. And the Cardinals counſel in this particular, paſſed for an effect of his incomparable Prudence.</p>
                  <p>Theſe things being thus concluded on, and orders given out accordingly, the King commanded the Marſhal <hi>de Crequis</hi> to return back to the Conſtable of <hi>Lesdiguierres,</hi> with further confirmation of what ever had formerly been ſent to him by the <hi>Sieur de St. Gerry</hi> in order to his Propoſals.

He hath an advantage very conſiderable ſeeing it ſerves him to put his own Eſtates in ſafety, and that he doth ingage that Prince ſo much the more ſtrictly, whom he makes chief of his deſign, to keep his word with him; becauſe if he once break off he may freely abandon him, and ſuffer him to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh under his enemies Arms, without putting himſelf to the trouble of making a Treaty of Peace, or breaking the Laws of Alliance, which do not oblige to any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther aſſiſting of him, who hath once broke his word.</p>

He preſently propoſed to him his Brother the Cardinal de Saint <hi>Onufra,</hi> to which the <hi>Sieur de Bethune</hi> only anſwered, that he was very capeable of the Legation. But that they that have been ſo long in a Cloyſter, living in ſuch an extraordinary Piety as he did, would commonly judge by the rules of devotion, which being ſo, it might happen that he would not conſider at all the affair of the <hi>Valtoline,</hi> more then by the ſpecious pretext, which the Spaniards had given out for their invaſion, and thus conſidering all in a ſpiritual way, without regarding thoſe intereſts of ſtate, which would happen, there could hardly be found all the neceſſary qualifications, to make the peace between the people, who ſhould be intereſſed it it.

                  <p>IT is no leſſe Glorious, then profitable to the Pope to mediate Peace between Princes; one of the beſt and nobleſt properties of the Sun, is to eſtabliſh ſuch a Temperature, and moderation amongſt the divers and ſundry Elements, that they may all ſubſiſt together, and contribute to the preſervation of the univerſe; for without this as the Naturaliſts have obſerved, the Elementary World would revers to it's firſt nothing, by reaſon of the diſharmony which would remain between them: Juſt ſo the moderation which the Popes (who are in the Church, as the Sun in Heaven) ſhall uſe amid'ſt the broyls and wars, which ſhall at any time ariſe amongſt Chriſtian Princes, is a work which contributeth to their great glory and ſplendor. If it be honourable to them, it cannot be leſſe advantageous to, ſeeing their authority, is never ſo conſiderable as in times of Peace, and that their Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles are no more heard or regarded in war then a civil Magiſtrats command amidſt a mutiny or inſurrection. Certainly nothing can ſo well befit them as this, they having the honour to be Chriſts vicars here on earth, who took the fleſh upon him, that he might bring peace to all the world, which alſo he recommended to his Apoſtles, as the thing he would have moſt cheri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

Let us now ſpeak of another important Affair, which was treated on in the Court of <hi>Room</hi> for Madam the Kings Siſter: we have already told you about the end of the forgoing yeer, that the match with the Prince of <hi>Wals</hi> being concluded, Father <hi>Berule</hi> was ſent to <hi>Room,</hi> to procure a diſperſe for it, where being arrived and preſented to his Holineſs by the Sieur de <hi>Bethune,</hi> he ſupplicated his Holineſs, on his Maſter behalf, that he would bee pleaſed to grant him the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſation for it.</p>
                  <p>The Pope receiv'd him, with ſuch honour, as is due to thoſe who are ſent from the firſt of Chriſtian Princes; and as to that which concern'd the diſpenſe, his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs told him, that he having already accorded one of the like to the Spaniards, when as the Match with the ſame Prince was upon the point of concluſion with the <hi>Infant</hi> of <hi>Spaine,</hi> he had done it with the advice of the Cardinals then, and could not now conclude it, without acquainting them with it; but however promiſed him, that they who were ſuſpected to be againſt the French intereſt, ſhould not be called to the conſultation, but that others which favoured it ſhould be put in their places: but withal to teſtifie his good will to the King, he would do one thing which he had not accorded to the Spaniards, that is, he would convocate the Conſiſtory of Cardinals in his own preſence, that he might give the quicker diſpatch to it. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:56802:36"/>in a few dayes after, he named the Cardinals, but he was not ſo good as his word in convocating them before himſelf, whether it were that ſo extraordinary a grace might have exaſperated the Spaniards, with whom he had no great mind to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broyl himſelf, or becauſe he imagined the Cardinals would not meet with any ſo great difficulties, as might require his preſence for the granting of the diſpenſe: and this was as much as paſſed upon the firſt motion, though afterwards many diſputes did ariſe, either becauſe it is ordinary with thoſe who judge of affaires in the Court of <hi>Room,</hi> to ſeek all advantages for Religion, and to raiſe queſtions where there are none, that their final reſults may be the more vallid; or elſe becauſe Father <hi>Berule</hi> treating with the Cardinals in private<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> had perſwaded them to ad ſome other things in the diſpenſe, then had been concluded in the Articles. Theſe difficulties thus riſen, ingaged the <hi>Sieur de Bethune,</hi> who underſtood not whence they came, to joyn himſelf to the Father <hi>Berule,</hi> and that he might overcome them he often repreſented to his Holineſs, that the great zeal his Maſter had for the Church, had induced him to take a great deal of paines, for the obtaining the moſt advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous conditions in the Articles, that could be hoped for by the Engliſh Catholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques. That the Spaniards having conſented that ſuch children as ſhould be born of this Marriage, ſhould be brought up by the Queen, only until their age of twelve yeers, but the King not contented with that, had obtained it until the thirteenth yeer, which was no inconſiderable buſineſſe, becauſe in that age it is that children take ſuch impreſſions of Religion, as will not eaſily be rooted out in future. He was not deficient in repreſenting to him, both the hapineſs and glory, that it would for ever be to his Popedom, if the eldſt ſon who ſhould be born, ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligiouſly preſerve thoſe inſtructions in his riper age, which the Queen ſhould give him, and at laſt eſtabliſh the Church of <hi>England</hi> in it's liberty and ſplendour. That the fruits of this Alliance were to be conſidered by the advantage, which might happen by it hereafter, eſpecially ſeeing in the laſt Article, the King of <hi>Great Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tany</hi> promiſed to treat with more ſweetneſs, and allow more liberty and freedom to the Catholiques, in behalf of the alliance with France, then otherwiſe he would have done, for that of <hi>Spain;</hi> that he was bound by oath to perform it; that it was true, the Spaniards had demanded more, that is, a publique Church in England, but withal they could not procure it to be granted, and that indeed there was not any thing more to be expected, then what had been alreaded concluded; that all which is to be wiſhed, is not alwayes poſſible; and after all, that the three princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal things which ought to be conſidered had been agree to, which was the aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the Princeſs her conſcience, the education of ſuch children as God ſhould bleſſe her with, and the liberty of Catholique: he alſo went and related the ſame to the Deputies. At laſt after three ſeveral meetings upon the buſineſs, they thought (ſo much had Father <hi>Berule</hi> poſſeſſed them with hopes, when he diſcourſed with them in private) that neither they nor the Pope himſelf could ſafely grant the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

That the Engliſh ſhould not by any means endeavour, to draw off the Princeſſes ſervants from the Catholique Religion, nor thoſe of the Meſſieurs her Children, whilſt they ſhould remain with her. Laſtly that the King of <hi>England</hi> ſhould ſwear not to fail in either of thoſe two things, and that the King of <hi>France,</hi> ſhould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe his Holineſs to cauſe thoſe Articles to be obſerved, to which the King of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> ſhould oblige himſelf. The <hi>Sieur de Bethune</hi> did much wonder, that they ſhould ſo earneſtly ad thoſe Conditions to the Articles, which were not only capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of retarding, but alſo of quite breaking of the match, and conſequently bring the Engliſh Catholiques into a greater perſecution then ever. But all was an effect of Father <hi>Berules</hi> zeal, which was a little too hot, and which prepoſſeſſed both the Pope and Cardinals, with ſuch ſtrong impreſſions, that they were irreſiſtably bent up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, this good man making it appear by his tranſaction, that the moſt ſpiritual men,

                  <p>IT is a great Imprudence in an Embaſſadour, to move contrary to his Inſtruction, and to raiſe difficulties in a buſineſs which is committed to him by following his own ſenſe: Orders are to Embaſſadours as Compaſſes to Pylots, and as a Pylot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth himſelf to the danger of Shipwrack, when as he will take no other guide in his voyage but his own <hi>Caprichio,</hi> ſo an Embaſſadour endangereth the ſucceſs of his negotiation, if he doth neglect to follow thoſe Orders which are given to him: he ought to conſider, that the perſon who imploys him, hath more knowledge of the Affair then himſelf. That he not having given him a full Liberty to do whatſoever he ſhould think fit, thoſe are the onely means which he is commanded to follow, that muſt guide him to the end of his Affair, and that if he doth not adhere to them he doth not onely run the hazard of loſing himſelf, but alſo of bringing his Maſter into ſuch trouble, as he wil have ſomewhat to do ere he get clear of them. The Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians did heretofore, think this to be a buſineſs of ſo great importance, that they condemned their Embaſsadours to die, whom they had ſent into <hi>Arcadia,</hi> for one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly returning home by another Coaſt, then that which they were commanded, though they had well diſpatched the Affair they were imployed on, as it is reported by <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an.</hi> It is true, the face of things may alter after an Embaſsadours departure, and if ſo, he muſt have his eyes in his head, it being permitted him to vary the means which are preſcribed to him, for the eaſier obtaining the end of his Affair: But in caſe Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs be not altered, he is bound to ſtick cloſe to his Inſtructions, under penalty of being very faulty; <hi>Manlius</hi> did not ſpare his own ſon, for fighting with the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my contrary to his order, though he got the better of them; for a Captain never ought to aſsault an Enemy contrary to his Generals command, though he be aſsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to overcome him: And that Embaſsador deſerveth ſeverely to be chaſtiſed, who ſhall propoſe things contrary to thoſe which are commanded him; for the manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a Treaty is ſometimes not a jot leſs conſiderable to the good of a State, then the Conduct of a War.

This was eaſie to be demonſtrated, but the <hi>Nuntio</hi> being of an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent nature in affairs, as alſo obliged to follow his Holineſſes Intereſts, beſeech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Miniſters to find out ſome expedient to ſatisfie his Holineſs, without imbroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the buſineſs with the King of <hi>England;</hi> promiſing that he would write to him very effectually about the neceſſity that did appear, for the taking away all obſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and difficulties, which might bring any delay to the marriage.

                  <p>The King of <hi>England</hi> did not receive the news without much wonder; but how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſeeing it had been agreed, that the children who ſhould be born of this match, were to be educated by the Princeſſe, untill their reſpective ages of thirteen years, and that her ſervants were to be Catholicks, and to have all freedome for the exerciſe of their Religion, hee conſented to all that was deſired; as that the Officers of thoſe Children ſhould be Catholick, and ſhould have no trouble in their Religion; accordingly hee ſent all manner of aſſurances to the King, but not a word of ſwearing to it, which was enough without urging him to take his oath for performance. The King gave all thoſe aſſurances in writing which his Holineſs expected; the Princeſs alſo writ a Letter to the Pope, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſhe promiſed upon her Parol, not to chuſe any Officers for thoſe Children which God ſhould heſtow upon her, but ſuch as ſhould be Catholicks. All Conditions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus reſolved on, it was verily beleeved, there could be no further difficulties rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed at <hi>Rome.</hi> There were two extraordinary Courtiers diſpatched one by Sea, the other by Land, to the <hi>Sieur de Bethune,</hi> with Orders to procure the diſpenſe to bee amended withall expedition, and to beſeech the Pope in his Majeſties name, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch it according to the Articles, which had been newly agreed on, without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acting a new Oath. The <hi>Sieur de Bethune</hi> having received one of theſe Diſpatches acquitted himſelf of his duty with all kind of Prudence, and did not forget to uſe his very utmoſt diligence to procure that ſatisfaction for his Majeſty; he ſpake to the People with a great deal of affection, by re-preſenting to him thoſe great bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings which heaven had beſtowed on the Church ſince his Majeſty came to the Crown, and with what zeal his Majeſty had imployed his Arms againſt the Hereticks; all which ought to make him be much eſteemed by the holy Chair, in regard his demands could not be refuſed without ſome kind of injuſtice, both in relation to the acknowledgements which are due to him; as alſo, becauſe his Actions gave great aſſurance, that he would never omit any occaſion, which might tend to the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of the Church. He forgot not to repreſent to him, the dangers that would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue from a total breach, by the longer retardment of concluding the marriage, and the ſevere uſage that the Catholiques in <hi>England</hi> would conſequentially lie under. That what his Holineſs had thought fit to adde to the Articles already concluded on, was in a manner included in them already, and that the chief executing of them would reſt upon the diſcretion of thoſe, who ſhould have the honour to be neer the Princeſs; however, that his Maſter the King, that he might teſtifie the reſpect which he bore his Holineſs, had written to the King of <hi>Great Brittain</hi> who had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to it, excepting onely in the point of taking a new Oath, which he would no more preſs him upon, in regard of that Oath which he had already made in reſpect of Religion, the Princeſs and her ſervants, and the Liberties of the Engliſh Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques; and ſeeing that this new Oath was compriſed too in ſome ſort in the firſt Oath. That there was ſufficient proviſion made, both in relation to Religion and Liberty of Conſcience, for her Domeſtiques and Children, ſeeing they were to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main

He told him likewiſe, that the King his Maſter being bound to his Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, for the obſervation of thoſe things which ſhould be agreed to by the King of <hi>Great Brittain,</hi> was an aſſurance not leſſe valid then that of an heretique King. That his Majeſty had commanded him to ſupplicate his Holineſs, with all earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and not reſt barely there, but to tell him that his Holineſs was the more obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to grant him his requeſt, ſeeing he begged the confirmation of it rather out of reſpect then neceſſity, ſeeing that ſeveral famous Doctors were of opinion, that Catholiques in Heretiques Countries might freely contract Mariages, without any diſpenſe.</p>
                  <p>Theſe were the chief reaſons, which the <hi>Sieur de Bethune</hi> repreſented to his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, and likewiſe to the Cardinals, who were deputed in the buſineſſe of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſe. They ſoon apprehended the Juſtice and importance of them, and teſtified a great readineſſe, to do that which was deſired of them. The Pope ſent word to the Cardinals, that they ſhould give a quick diſpatch to the buſineſs, that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to give the King all the ſatisfaction he could wiſh for, both that he might ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg thoſe great benefits which his Majeſty had procured to the Church, as alſo becauſe he knew there could not any other thing be deſired from thoſe of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> Accordingly they met together, and concluded on it as the King deſired, and diſpatched it with a great deal of diligence to the Nontio, that it might be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to the King, who as quickly gave intelligence of it to the King of <hi>Great Britain.</hi>

The King had cauſed a houſe to be built of Timber work upon the Rivers ſide, where the Perfums and pleaſant ſmels, might make her an exchange of thoſe ill ſents of the Sea, into an ayr of Amber, Orange and Jeſſamy Flowers.

                  <p>MAgnificence is one of the greateſt virtues, which gives moſt luſter to Kings, who are no otherwiſe eſteemed great, but by their abilities to do greater things then others. That is it, which makes their names glorious amongſt Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, and likewiſe procures them more reſpect from their own ſubjects. Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers ſay, actions ought to be proportionate to the quality of the ſubject, which produceth them; whence it comes to paſſe, that that of Kings being the moſt emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent of al others, they ſhould not do any but magnificent things: and thus the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror <hi>Diocleſian</hi> ſaid publiquely. If this virtue be wel beſeeming them they are not at any time more obliged to exerciſe it, then at their own, or thoſe of their Families ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, for at ſuch times moſt eſpecially it is, that ſtrangers and their own ſubjects too, do reſort in greateſt abundance to their Courts; which at other times they themſelves are but ſeldome ſeen; ſo that it cannot but be a thing of great concern, then to give them impreſſions of an extraordinary reſpect, to the doing of which, no doubt but the luſtre of noble and magnificent Actions, doth very much contribute: Withall, if expences ought to be regulated by the occaſions upon which they are made, what more honourable and worthy ſubject can they be beſtowed on, then either their own, or the marriages of thoſe of their Blood? Beſides, ſeeing Wealth is not gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven them by Heaven, but onely to be honourably imployed, how much would any niggardlineſs be exploded and found fault with, on ſuch occaſions as thoſe are? would it not paſſe for an extream meanneſs of ſpirit? The goods of private men are their own, and for their own uſes, inſomuch that they have full power to diſpoſe of them as they pleaſe; but it is not ſo with Kings, they are obliged to imploy that which is lent them, towards the acquiring a reſpect neceſſary for the impreſſing of that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence and Honour into the Minds of the People, which is due unto them. Thoſe great Coſts and Charges, which are layed out on frivolous matters, are as ſoon for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten as the whiſtling of the Wind, neither do they carry with them the reputation of being magnificent; but it is not ſo when well uſed, and when they are expended upon urgent occaſions and great affairs. It is to imitate God (if done in order) who hath not onely the power of working outward Miracles, but alſo of doing them with weight, number, and meaſure.</p>
                  <p>It is moſt certain, Kings cannot in any thing more imitate the Divine Majeſty then in rendring themſelves admired amongſt men, by their magnificent Actions, to which purpoſe a noble expence, doth extraordinarily much conduce.</p>

That weakneſs of theirs which layes them open to be Preyed upon, is the thing which gives them moſt Power over mens Souls; were they but a little ſtronger to defend themſelves from the contrivances of thoſe who have deſigns upon them; they would not have ſo great an influence in perſwading moſt men to what ever they deſire.

The Prince of <hi>Piedmont</hi> was with the Duke his Father, and the Marſhal <hi>de Crequy,</hi> with the Conſtable his Father-in-law. The King, in Conſideration of the Alliance between <hi>Savoy</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> conſented that the Duke ſhould give the word, and that the Marſhal ſhould likewiſe pay the ſame reſpect to the Prince of <hi>Piedmont.</hi> The Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which they obſerved was thus, That the Conſtable ſhould march with the Avant guard, towards the Coaſt of <hi>Loppiata,</hi> and his Highneſs with the body of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my towards <hi>Cremolin.</hi> The Conſtable comming before <hi>Loppiata,</hi> the Inhabitants made ſome ſmall reſiſtance, but they were ſoon forced, and their Town Pillaged, to ſtrike a terrour into others: this induced thoſe of <hi>Gua,</hi> a City belonging to the Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories of <hi>Genoa,</hi> to ſend their Keys to the Duke, who when he ſent the Marqueſs of <hi>St. Reyran</hi> with his Regiment, to Quarter there, found ſome reſiſtance, for that <hi>Nicholas Doria</hi> in the mean time, had put in ſome Forces there, to defend it; ſo the Duke commanded the Count of <hi>Veriie,</hi> to march thither with certain Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:56802:40"/>which ſtrook ſuch a fright into <hi>Doria</hi> and his Forces, that they preſently leſt the place, and Captain <hi>Martin Corſeque,</hi> delivered it at the firſt ſummons. The City of <hi>Novy</hi> which is very large, ſent at the ſame time, to the Conſtable to aſſure him they would open their Gates; and accordingly he ſeized on it, and then turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing towards <hi>Gavy,</hi> he defeated in his march five Companies of Neopolitans, whom the Spaniards had ſent to ſecure the place, and ſhortly after the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with him to incounter with ſix thouſand men part being of Collonel <hi>Gaſees,</hi> ſome <hi>Modenois,</hi> and other ſome Parmeſans, who pretended to defend the Town. But they ſoon cut one party of them in peeces near <hi>Ottage,</hi> in a fight which laſted neer two hours, and then falling upon four Squadrons of Horſe, not far off the ſame place, they routed them with ſuch good ſucceſs, that they took the Town and Caſtle of <hi>Ottage</hi> with three and twenty Colours, killed above two hundred Neapolitans and Genoveſes upon the place, took above a thouſand Priſoners, and amongſt them the chief Commanders. Upon this defeat, they concluded to make themſelves Maſter of <hi>Gavy,</hi> which was abſolutely neceſſary for their marching up to <hi>Genoa.</hi> The Caſtle is built on a Rock, and the Town well fortified; inſomuch that many were of opinion, it would be a hard task to take it, ſeeing too that <hi>Barbaroſſa</hi> in the expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which he made in the time of <hi>Francis</hi> the firſt, into the River of <hi>Genoa,</hi> could not take it in. But the Conſtables courage, which was not uſed to ſtoop under any Fear, did not forbear to make his approaches upon the Town. He who command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it, made a Sally, with about three hundred men, of which two hundred were ſlain in the place, which ſo terrified thoſe of the Town, that they ſent an aſſurance that they would open their Gates; provided they might be protected from being Plundered and maintained in their ancient Priviledges, which was granted to them; and the Conſtable being got into the Town, began to beſiege the Caſtle. At the firſt, the Governour pretended a Reſolution to defend it, diſcharging ſeveral ſhot into the Town, beleeving that the Caſtle could not be battered, and ſuppoſing there were not any points of Rocks, upon which any Cannon could be mounted to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand it; but the Conſtable ſoon let him ſee that there was not any thing impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the courage of the French; for in a few days he had raiſed a Battery upon cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Rocks, which did ſo awe him, that he was forced to ſurrender upon Compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on the laſt of <hi>April.</hi> Some Spaniſh Relations ſay, that the Governour was rather frighted with Piſtol ſhot, then forced by the Cannon to ſurrender; but their anger was at the Conſtable, who had made himſelf Maſter of the place. After theſe happy exploits, the Prince of <hi>Piedmont</hi> took ten thouſand men of the Army, to go force the Paſſages of the Mountain <hi>Griego,</hi> where the Genoveſes were intrenched, and to make way for the Siege of <hi>Savonne.</hi> He preſently forced their Trenches, ſo that he had full Liberty to march as far as <hi>Pleve</hi> a Town ſcituated in the Mountains, defended with a good Caſtle, and ſeveral ſmall Forts, his courage made him reſolve to carry it by aſſault, after he had taken in thoſe little Forts, though it ſeemed capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of holding out a longer Siege, which was executed with ſo much reſolution and good ſucceſſe, that the place was won in an inſtant, the beſieged yeelding them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves (as ſoon as they found the Gates and Walls were already ſecured) upon condition of ſaving the lives of all ſuch as ſhould be found without Arms. All which was done with no ſmall reſiſtance, for there were at leaſt two hundred killed and taken, together with ſeven Colours, which were ſent by the Prince, to the Princeſs of <hi>Piedmont,</hi> and afterwards to the King, together with thoſe three and twenty others, which were taken at the defeat of <hi>Ottage,</hi> and the Staffs of two Maſters of the Camp, <hi>Caracciolo</hi> and <hi>Catanda,</hi> fent by the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> as the the fruits of thoſe Victories, which his Majeſties Armies had obtained, with a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in anſwer to that which was brought him, by the Marqueſs <hi>de Saluce.</hi> The Prince of <hi>Piedmont</hi> having ſuffered his Army to Pillage for about ſix and thirty hours in <hi>Pl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

After this once
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:56802:41"/>done, he ſummoned the City of <hi>Ventimelia,</hi> the inhabitants made ſome ſhew of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, but the Prince being come within a League of it, they ſoon ſent their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires to be admitted to Compoſition. The Caſtle made ſome difficulty of ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring, but when the Governour had once ſeen a Battery raiſed on the points of the Rocks, where five hundred Niſſars had drawn the Cannon by the ſtrength of their Arms, he reſolved to do as the Town had.

                  <p>FOrtune, or to ſpeak more properly, Divine Providence doth commonly favour thoſe, who being truly generous do attempt any great enterpriſe. Not that God worketh miracles, for the crowning them with ſucceſſe; but indeed, becauſe couragiouſneſs giveth them great advantages; eſpecially, when it is accompanied with Prudence, and that the Divine Providence co-operating with ſecond Cauſes, doth aſſiſt their indeavours, Courage begetteth a certain hope which like a Spur ſtirreth up to great attempts, from which Fear had formerly diverted them; cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage alone is ſufficient to ſtrike terrour into an enemy, who fighting more by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint then good will, do uſually give ground, when once they find themſelves vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorouſly aſſaulted. Who knoweth not that it is courage which perſwadeth to invade and ſubject other Countries. Experience hath often evinced, that an invading Prince hath a great advantage over him, who is onely intent how to defend himſelf; eſpecially if he be Prudent in falling on him, in a favourable conjuncture of time, as when his forces are diverted into other imployments, or worn out or unarmed. They who have moſt judiciouſly weighed the Victories of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> do much aſcribe them to his native Generouſneſs, which carried him on to attempt any thing, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the leaſt fear; inſomuch that he deſpiſed the un-relenting fury both of the Sea and Winds, which ſpare no man, and commanded the Pylot who conducted him, not to fear, ſince he carried <hi>Caeſars</hi> Fortune in his Boat. Never did his Souldiers ſhew their backs, no danger could affright him, well he knew death to be the end of life, but not that it was a miſ-fortune. He built his Glory upon Conqueſts, and the difficulty of his enterprizes re-doubled the Force of his Courage. Fortune was alwaies his friend, and he made it apparent, that nothing was impoſſible to a man of Reſolution.</p>

                  <p>FOrtune indeed did much adde to the Courage of the Arms of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Savoy,</hi> for the obtaining ſuch great Conqueſts in ſo little time, but much of the honour muſt be aſcribed unto the Cardinal, who firſt adviſed the expedition, who iſſued out all Orders under the Kings Authority, who executed them in ſo happy a conjuncture of time, that neither the Spaniards or Genoeſes, could poſſibly defend thoſe pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which were aſſaulted, by reaſon of their want of Forces: And laſtly, who had ſo good intelligence in the States of <hi>Genoa,</hi> that he did not a little contribute to the good ſucceſs of this deſign. Yet however Fortune, or rather Divine Providence, which over-ruleth Armies, doth but laugh at mans Wiſdome, and ſeemeth to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in diſtributing both good and bad ſucceſs to their deſigns: Thus was it, with the French and Savoyards, for the Scales ſeemed to turn againſt them, and their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts came to a Period. The Fame of theſe great Victories did ſo trouble the houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> that extraordinary preparations were made in <hi>Germany,</hi> for the ſending of a Potent Army, under the command of <hi>Feria,</hi> Governour of <hi>Milan,</hi> for the aſſiſting of the Genoeſes. The Marqueſs <hi>de St. Croix,</hi> was likewiſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:56802:41"/>to put to Sea, a Fleet deſigned for that purpoſe, who had imbarked neer four thouſand Souldiers, in twenty five Gallies, and five Gallions of <hi>Sicilia.</hi> Theſe Forces of the Enemy came with a great advantage, the Plague having conſumed at leaſt two thirds of the French ſince their arrival in <hi>Italy.</hi> The Marſhal <hi>de Crequy</hi> fell ſick of it, and not long after the Conſtable. Beſides, divers Cities of <hi>Genoa,</hi> ſeemed to ſhake off the yoke of their Obedience, with joy and delight, they turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed about, and before the end of <hi>June,</hi> riſe againſt their new Governours and Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſons with great violence, as if Fortune had purpoſely done it, to ſhew that miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes ſeldome come ſingle. And laſtly, the ill-management of the Artillery, and want of Waggons for the Carriage of Proviſions for the Army (of all which the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> was in fault) occaſioned more diſaſters then all the reſt; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the jealouſies which grew between him and the Conſtable, did not a little add to compleat them. Things being in this poſture, did much incourage the Spaniards, and the Duke <hi>de Feria,</hi> that he might not loſe the advantage of it, entred into <hi>Montferrat,</hi> about the beginning of <hi>July,</hi> where he took <hi>Spione</hi> by force, and not long after <hi>Acqui,</hi> which the Conſtable had made his Magazine of Arms, and had therin placed 3. Regiments to guard the munitions which he had there ſtowed up. The taking of this place neceſſitated the Prince of <hi>Piedmont,</hi> and the Conſtable to recall the Forces then marching towards <hi>Savonne,</hi> that they might joyntly fall on upon the Duke of <hi>Feria;</hi> but they found him incamp'd ſo advantagiouſly at <hi>Ferzo</hi> between <hi>Biſtague</hi> and <hi>Acqui,</hi> that they could not poſſibly come neer him, the Paſſages being ſo narrow, that onely two men could march a Breaſt.</p>
                  <p>At the ſame time, the inhabitants of <hi>Albengua, Novy,</hi> and <hi>Acquy,</hi> revolted againſt the French Gariſons; and ſhortly after, divers other leſſe places, and ſix thouſand Genoeſes comming before <hi>Gavio,</hi> the Governour and his ſon, cowardly ſurrendred the place, upon condition to be carried ſafely into <hi>France.</hi> The Genoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes received them upon this Compoſition, and conducted them accordingly; but being there arrived, their Treachery was not long unpuniſhed by the Parliament of <hi>Provence; Gonvernon</hi> the ſon being hanged, the Fathers body taken up, burned, and his Aſhes thrown into the Ayr (death having prevented the execution of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon him.) True it is, Courage doth oftentimes compell Fortune to be fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable, and the French Army, though thus perſecuted, did yet make head, againſt the Duke <hi>de Feria,</hi> and prevented his further progreſs, ſo that he was forced to make ſome other diverſion, by entring upon <hi>Piedmont,</hi> and lying down before <hi>Aſt,</hi> with deſign to beſiege it. The Conſtable was yet there, very weak, it being thought he would have died, ſo that he went off, and the Marſhal <hi>de Crequy,</hi> upon the thirtieth of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> came into his place with four thouſand French.</p>
                  <p>The ſame day he made a Sally, with the Prince of <hi>Carignan,</hi> forced the enemy from a Bridge, which they had kept ſix dayes, and made them run away with ſhame, though they had eighteen thouſand foot, and ſeven hundred horſe. Was not this a generous exploit of the French, and did it not ſufficiently teſtifie, that had they been near enough to have had recruits and ammunitions from <hi>France,</hi> or had the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> cauſed thoſe refreſhments to have been brought for the Army which by the Articles of the Treaty he was obliged, they had not ſo eaſily loſt, what they had ſo happily obtained. But they were induced to under goe thoſe diſaſters which are incident to all men, who invade a Forraign Country upon the hopes of a League.</p>

                  <p>ALthough thoſe Wars, which are begun by Princes leagued together, have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes happy beginnings; yet it ſeldome comes to paſſe, that they do end in a good ſucceſs. There need no other proof then that of the Wars, which our Kings have made in <hi>Italy,</hi> for ſix ſcore years laſt paſt. But that we may not dwell upon examples, is not that Prince who truſteth in the promiſe of his Confederates, like the man who expoſeth all his Goods upon the Sea in a leaky Veſſel? Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:56802:42"/>hath ſhewed us in a thouſand incounters, that Princes have ſo many overtures made, by which one may win upon them, and with-draw them from Leagues, that it is almoſt impoſſible to have any abſolute aſſurance of them. One of the chiefeſt ties which holdeth them faſt, is to have in poſſeſſion ſome ſtrong place, for a gage of their Fidelity; but there are few who will thus diſpoſſeſs themſelves; doubting leaſt he, into whoſe hands it be intruſted, will retain it for good and all, by ſaying or perſwading them that they have been defective in their word, in ſome one thing or other; as <hi>Charls</hi> the eighth did, after he had received the Florentine Towns in depoſit. It is likewiſe dubious, leſt the ſeveral Troops or divers Princes in an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my together, ſhould grow jealous of one another, and then the leaſt diſtruſt or broyls which might ariſe between them, were enough to withdraw him, who ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gineth himſelf offended; and if there were nothing elſe, there need no more but this to draw off Confederates from a League, barely to ſatisfie them in their parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Intereſts; for ſeeing that is it, which is the onely end and aim of all Princes, they will no longer hold together, then it may bee for their advantage. There do oftentimes too happen very great inconveniences; eſpecially, when their united Forces are to march into far diſtant places, they who border upon thoſe Countries which are to be aſſaulted, take no care to refreſh themſelves, either by new troops or neceſſary proviſions for the War, for that thoſe who inhabit further off, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing eaſily able to provide for this defect, fall into ruine of themſelves, or elſe their enemies quickly put them to flight. Many united Princes are never comparable to one alone, nor ever capable of encompaſſing ſuch great enterpriſes, as a ſingle Prince with his own Subjects, though much inferiour to them in point of numbers.</p>

                  <p>The Cardinal having ſent out Orders from the King, to the Governours of the Provinces, to fall upon him, as ſoon as ever he ſhould appear in the Field. The Count of <hi>Carmain</hi> Governour of <hi>Foix,</hi> was preſently upon his skirts, and impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded not onely the Progreſs of his Rebellion; but alſo, getting into <hi>Ruelle</hi> and <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reze,</hi> after the other had forſaken them, he ſo dealt with the Conſuls, that they confeſſed their fault, and proteſted not to take part with him any more. And as the Authority of Parliaments on ſuch occaſions, ought to uphold the Courages and Fidelities of thoſe who Conduct the Kings Armies; ſo that of <hi>Tholouſe,</hi> was not wanting to command the Souldiers who were aſſembled with the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> to ſeparate themſelves, and to give Orders to the Nobility and Commonalty to fall up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, to forbear all ſort of Commerce with thoſe of <hi>Caſtres,</hi> and to tranſlate the Royal and Eccleſiaſtique juriſdictions, and the Receipt of the Kings Monies un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Town of <hi>Lautrec,</hi> with command to all the Judges and Officers to come thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as well to prevent the Kings monies from falling into their hands, as alſo to preſerve Juſtice in its Integrity, and to diminiſh the Force and Power of that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious City. The ſame Parliament too, granted an Arreſt for the ſeizure of all the Goods, any waies belonging to thoſe who were revolted, both to puniſh them, and deter others who were ready to follow them. The Half divided Chamber of <hi>Beziers,</hi> half Hugonots, and half Papiſts, did as much, and declared (according to the Kings Edict, of the 25th. of <hi>January</hi> the ſame year) the ſaid Duke to bee guilty of <hi>Laeſa Majeſtatis,</hi> to be a troubler of the Publick Peace, as alſo all his Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bettors and Adherents, and Prohibited both Cities and particular perſons, to hold any communication with him, and injoyning all his Majeſties Subjects, to fall upon any Troops that ſhould injure them, to cut them in peeces, and to pull down the Houſes and Caſtles of ſuch Noble men as were of that Faction.</p>
                  <p>But the Order which the Cardinal perſwaded his Majeſty to ſend was more power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full then all thoſe others; for the preventing the further progreſs of this Rebellion ſeeing it was accompanied with an extraordinary diligence.

The Marſhal had the Marqueſs <hi>de Ragny,</hi> and the Count <hi>de Carmain</hi> for Marſhals of the Field, and that no longer time might be loſt, he ſoon after came to the place, where he had deſigned the Rendezvouz for the whole Army, and upon his way forced the Caſtles of <hi>Blauc</hi> and <hi>Dovac,</hi> which ſerved for Retreits to thoſe who were revolted. After the Companies were aſſembled together, and a review taken of the whole Army, he made his Forces be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Caſtres</hi> to Plunder the Country. The <hi>Sieur de Ferrieres</hi> who commanded the
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:56802:43"/>Rebels horſe, made a Salley upon the Marſhal, as ſoon as he came within view of the Town, but they were forced to turn back again with more haſt then he came out, and not onely ſo, but himſelf and three or four more of his own party, were leſt wounded upon the place. The Pioneers and Plunderers played their parts un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Protection of the Army, which countenanced them in it; and notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the many ſhot and skirmiſhes, in which many were hurt and ſlain, both of one ſide and t'other, they did their work ſo exactly, that there was not a Tree, Vine, or Stalk of Corn ſtanding any where neer the City. In this <hi>interim,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> attempted to become Maſter of <hi>Sommieres,</hi> and led up his Army to it, and comming thither juſt upon day breaking, hee approached it by one of the Gates, which being ſoon thrown down, made way for his entrance; but thinking to ſurprize the Caſtle too, <hi>Maſillac</hi> the Governour of it, repelled all his Attempts with ſuch Courage, that having received the ſuccours of ten thouſand foot, which the <hi>Sieur de Valenſay</hi> had ſent to him from <hi>Montpellier,</hi> the Duke was forced to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire to <hi>Anduze,</hi> where he was not well received. After this, the Marſhal <hi>de The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines</hi> went without more adoe to beſiege <hi>St. Paul</hi> and <hi>Miatte,</hi> which lie upon the River <hi>Langouſt</hi> between <hi>Caſtres</hi> and <hi>Lavaur;</hi> when he had Quartered his Army before <hi>St. Paul,</hi> he forced it in few dayes, and rifled divers of the Inhabitants that were got into <hi>Miatte;</hi> but they had ſmall hopes of any comfort, ſo they ſent to the Marſhal to deſire Articles, which being granted, he entred and took poſſeſſion of the Town.</p>
                  <p>But all this was nothing worth, if he did not attempt to fight the Duke of <hi>Rohan,</hi> and cut off his Forces, ſo he reſolved to follow him, and over-taking him at <hi>Vianes</hi> in <hi>Albigeois,</hi> he ſet the Army into Battalia to fight him. The Duke was Quartrred in <hi>Vianes,</hi> and about two thouſand of his Foot were at <hi>Peyreſequade,</hi> which is at the Foot of the Mountains whereon <hi>Vianes</hi> is ſcituated. The Count <hi>de Carmain</hi> went to view them, and having reported to the Marſhal the Condition in which he found them, it was reſolved to fight them. The Marſhal with his Sword in his hand mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched in the Head of the Army. The Marqueſs <hi>de Cragny</hi> and the Count of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main,</hi> took their Stations one upon his right, t'other upon his left hand, and at the ſame inſtant, the whole Army couragiouſly advanced towards the Enemy, with ſo much Reſolution, that nothing more could have been wiſhed, but onely that they had made a little more reſiſtance, for that there was not one ſingle man of them ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; for whileſt thoſe who made the firſt encounter were at it, the reſt got into <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anes,</hi> who were however ſo cloſely purſued by the Marſhals forces, that the Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Normandy</hi> was hard at their heels, entring into the Town with them. Thus he remained Maſter of <hi>Peyreſequade,</hi> where there were about one hundred and fifty of the Rebels Souldiers killed and hurt, all which the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> beheld from a Fort in <hi>Vianes</hi> where he then was, from which time forwards he began to deſpair of doing any great matters for the future, eſpecially ſince he ſaw himſelf ſo cloſely followed, and that the Cardinal had taken ſuch a courſe in <hi>Languedoc,</hi> that the King could have raiſed more men in twenty four hours, then the Duke in a whole moneth.</p>

The <hi>Sieur de Soubize</hi> who had then great and ſmall onely thirty nine Veſſels, would not expect the comming of the Admiral <hi>Montmorency</hi> to the Kings Ships, though he had procured a promiſe from the <hi>Sieur Hautyn</hi> the Hollanders Admiral, under favour of the conformity of their Religion, and had likewiſe paſſed his own Parole, that neither part ſhould at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt any thing untill the Treaty of Peace, which was agitating at Court, were ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther abſolutely concluded or broken off; which he did not faithfully perform on his part; for taking advantage of his promiſe given, hee took occaſion to come upon him unprovided, and on the nineteenth of <hi>July</hi> he put forth to Sea, and having the Wind and Sea favourable, in half an hour he came up to the Hollanders Ships, and ſent two Fire-boats chained together full of Artificial Fire-works, to fall on the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral, whom they burned quite down in a very little while, not giving liberty for to ſave any but ſuch as could ſwim, ſo that above a hundred were drowned in it.</p>
                  <p>This Action full both of Inſolency and breach of Faith, ingaged the Kings Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy to purſue them four hours together. The Ayr did ring again with the Cannon ſhot, which ſunk ſome of their Veſſels, and killed divers of their men: But the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon was ſo favourable to him, that he got into <hi>St. Martin de Ree,</hi> and to <hi>Chef de Bay.</hi> The Duke of <hi>Montmorancy</hi> after the firſt news of the Encounter, was ordered to ſpeed away, and to give them Battel. He was received with a great deal of joy by the whole Fleet, who were very impatient to be revenged on <hi>Soubize,</hi> for the affront he had put upon them. The Duke put forth to Sea, the <hi>Sieurs de Saint Luc, de Roche-Foucaud,</hi> and <hi>de Thoyras</hi> made themſelves ready to go on ſhore, under the favour of the Admirals Arrival. And on Sunday the fourteenth of <hi>September</hi> about eleven at night, the Duke having given the ſign for falling on, they went to At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taque
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:56802:45"/>
                     <hi>Soubize's</hi> Fleet, which lay at Anchor in <hi>Loys</hi> Channel, under the Iſland of <hi>Re.</hi> Upon the firſt approach near the enemies Veſſels, there were ſo many Cannon ſhot diſcharged on them, that they were forced to retire to the further end of the Channel, and the Sea falling off, they all ſtuck on the Shelf. The Duke finding them in this Condition, made his Ships advance to ſhelter the landing of the <hi>Sieurs de St. Luc, de la Roche-Foucaude, &amp; de Thoyras,</hi> amid'ſt the ſmoke of the Powder, which hindered the Rebels from diſcovering it. There were alſo ten other Ships ſent out, who were to go to the Road of <hi>Chef de Bay,</hi> to take order, that the <hi>Roche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lois</hi> might ſend no new Troops to the Iſle of <hi>Re,</hi> who forced back into the Port the Count <hi>de Laval,</hi> who was going out upon that deſign. The Kings Army being landed, the Enemy quickly perceived it, and as ſoon came to receive them, and u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed their utmoſt to repel them. The Combate laſted three days out-right, with a great deal of obſtinacy on both parts, the Rebels defending themſelves in every place, that was never ſo little tenable, but it ended to the great advantage of the Kings Army, which muſt be aſcribed to the Valour and Conduct of thoſe who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded it; for that they preſently made themſelves Maſters of the Iſle of <hi>Re,</hi> cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſome part of the Enemy in peeces, taking other ſome Priſoners, and letting the reſt eſcape into their Ships. The <hi>Sieur de Soubize</hi> was one of thoſe, who eſcaped into <hi>Oleron,</hi> ſuch care he had, that he might not be taken, that he never came into the Fight at all. They who had got clear into their Ships, would have tried one bout more to have had their revenge, the wind being fair for them: But the Duke kept the Army in a readineſs to fight, gave the ſignal and fell upon them; the Seamen were ſo dexterous, that they got the wind of them in leſſe then two hours, there were above two thouſand ſhot made; and though the night came on, yet the Fight ended not; for the Duke perceiving nine of the greateſt Ships retiring towards <hi>Rochel,</hi> purſued them with ſuch good ſucceſſe, that hee came up with them about day break, and two others of their biggeſt Ships, were not able to get off, for want of water, and ſo ſtuck on ground, but long they did not ſo continue before they were taken. It is true, thoſe of the Army who were got upon the Orelop, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving killed all they met with, the Souldiers who were in the Hold, ſet fire to the Powder, and blew up all above with ſuch force, that the Splinters of it were carried a quarter of a League off, three of the Kings Ships were burned with it, and above three hundred men loſt, amongſt which were the Count of <hi>Vauvert,</hi> the <hi>Sieur de Ville Neufeu,</hi> and <hi>Veilon</hi> a Captain of <hi>Holland.</hi> This accident did much take off from the content of the Victory, yet it cannot be denied but that it was glorious enough for the happineſſe of <hi>France,</hi> in reducing the Rebels to that paſſe, that they could not any more make any attempts by Sea. Thus the reſt of their Veſſels which were of no great conſequence retired, ſome to <hi>Rochel,</hi> and ſome into other places, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as the Wind did drive them, but never durſt afterwards appear any more. Theſe things thus ended, the Duke of <hi>Montmorancy,</hi> landed at <hi>Oleron,</hi> where he met with no reſiſtance, the <hi>Sieur de Soubize</hi> having withdrawn himſelf into <hi>England,</hi> ſo that the whole Province was ſetled in quiet both by Sea and Land, of all which his Majeſty was very certainly informed, who received the newes with much joy.</p>

                  <p>WHatever joys or delights Fortune inſinuateth into thoſe who revolt, yet it is uſually ſeen, that all their deſigns end in ill ſucceſs.

They cannot more properly bee likened to any thing, then to thoſe high Mountains, the points of whoſe Rocks ſeem to hreaten Heaven, and which ſending forth ſtore of Clouds out of their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomes, ſeem to obſcure the light of the Sun, though at laſt they are all diſſipated by that fair Planet of the day, who making thoſe very ſame Clouds into Thunder-bolts, cauſeth them to fall down upon them for to chaſtiſe their Inſolency: And is it not
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:56802:45"/>the ſame thing with Grandees who revolt and Rebell? After they have made ſome attempts upon the Authority of their Soveraign, are they not in fine ruined and brought into extremities by the Power of his Armes, who takes occaſion to cruſh them to peeces with that Power, which they would have uſurped themſelves, and did not of right belong unto them? Hiſtory abounds with exemplary Proofs of this Truth, the many that are, would ſpoil the deſign of quoting two or three onely.

                  <p>WHileſt the Fire of this Civil War was burning up of <hi>Languedoc.</hi> The Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal <hi>Barbarini</hi> Legate from the Pope, arrived in <hi>France</hi> and came to <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeille,</hi> where he was received with great honour, as alſo at <hi>Lyon,</hi> according to the Orders ſent by the King. He came to <hi>Paris</hi> the one and twentieth of <hi>May,</hi> and his Majeſty cauſed his entrance to be made with the moſt Pomp that hath been ſeen for a perſon of his condition. I ſhall not need inſiſt on the relating that he is bound by the Laws of the Kingdome, before he Officiate the Function of a Legate to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the Brief, which the Pope hath given him for the imployment to the Parliament of <hi>Paris,</hi> which is a Cuſtome ſo ancient, that I ſhall omit ſpeaking any more of it; but I ſhall obſerve that the Pope having ommitted in the Brief, to give the King the Title of King of <hi>Navar,</hi> which could not be denied to him without Injuſtice, the Parliament refuſed to acknowledge it, and obliged him not to make any further pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedure in the buſineſſe untill it were amended. The Legate comming to <hi>Paris,</hi> alighted at <hi>St. James de Haut-pas,</hi> where the Clergy of the City, the concourſe of the Court, and other Officers to the number of twelve thouſand went to ſalute him and receive his Benediction. After this, the Prelates of <hi>Paris</hi> came to do their reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects to him; there was a little diſpute in what habit they ſhould appear before him, the Legate deſiring they ſhould be in their Rockets and Camail covered over with a Mantlet, as a mark that they had no power in his preſence; but the Prelates not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to ſtoop to this Order, by reaſon it was contrary to the Rules of the French Church, it was concluded in the middle way between both, to give ſome ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Legate, that they ſhould go ſo habited to ſalute him, and that they ſhould accordingly accompany him in the Cavalcade to <hi>Noſtre-Dame,</hi> where being come, they were to take off their Mantlets, but all was done under a <hi>Proviſo</hi> of ſaving their ancient right. The King ſent the Duke of <hi>Nemours,</hi> the <hi>Sieur de Bonnevil,</hi> the Introductor of Embaſſadours, and ſeveral other Lords of great quality, to receive him at his firſt arrival.</p>
                  <p>At night <hi>Monſieur</hi> the Kings Brother, waited on him with a great number of Lords, and ſaluted him with extraordinary reſpects, and one his entrance accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panying him, gave him the right hand. The ſame day he had Audience from the King, where nothing paſſed onely Complements; but the next day he propoſed what the Pope had given him in charge, hee exhorted the King in general terms to Peace, he urged his Majeſty to reſtore things in the <hi>Valtoline</hi> to their former State, as they were before the Army of the confederated Princes entred into it, and beſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched him to grant a Ceſſation of Arms in <hi>Italy.</hi> His Majeſty anſwered to theſe
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:56802:46"/>three Propoſitions, that he was ever inclined to Peace, and that he would ſtill be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to it; provided it were for the Publick ſafety, and honourable for him and his Allies. That as to what concerned the <hi>Valtoline,</hi> the Treaty of <hi>Madrid</hi> made but a few years before, had made proviſion for all thoſe difficulties, which have ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen ever ſince, and that he deſired the execution of it, as to the Ceſſation of Arms, that he could by no means hearken to it, by reaſon of the prejudice it would bee to himſelf and his Allies and the great advantage thoſe of the adverſe Party might make out of it. This was the ſum of what paſſed on both ſides.

                        </gap>ur</hi> the Cardinal anſwered, that the King had declared openly enough in his audience his intenſions concerning the ceſſation of Arms in <hi>Italy,</hi> and that if he ſhould ſubmit to it, it would be a means of giving his enemies time and leiſure to gather their forces together, and to fortifie themſelves againſt his Majeſty and his Allyes: That the Peace would as eaſily be concluded on as the War, if either party would but hearken to Reaſon, ſeeing the principal difficulties of State had been concluded in the Treaty of <hi>Madrid.</hi> That there need nothing but ſome pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion to be made in point of Religion, to which his Majeſty was much inclined: That as to what he deſired ſatisfaction in to his Holyneſs, his anſwer was, his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty never having conſented to the depoſit in his Holyneſs hands any longer then the time limited, in which he ought to have cauſed the Treaty of <hi>Madrid</hi> to have been executed, his Holyneſs had not any reaſon to complain<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and eſpecially too conſidering the ſeveral declarations which had been made by the Sieur <hi>de Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thun</hi> in his Majeſties name, That the King could not any longer ſuffer the <hi>Griſons</hi> to be diſpoſſeſſed of thoſe Forts which did belong unto them; Declarations which his Holyneſs himſelf thought to be reaſonable, for that he had upon them ſent for the Spaniards to chide them for it: Beſides the reſpect which the Marquis <hi>de Coeu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res</hi> ſhewed to his Holyneſſe's Arms and Enſigns in the eye of the whole world, did defend him from any blame which might be layd to his charge, for having been defective in giving due honour to the holy Chair. But that notwithſtanding all theſe things his Majeſty did bear ſo great a reverence to his Holyneſs, that he would cauſe his Ambaſſadour, to ſay all thoſe words of reſpect and civility which ſhould be thought fit; as alſo that after the peace ſhould be concluded, his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty would conſent to deliver up into his Holyneſs's hands, the Fort of <hi>Chi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The Legat had other audiences, and other conferences paſt between him and the Miniſters, where nothing more was propoſed nor anſwered: But the King being at <hi>Fountainbleau,</hi> the Legate made a third propoſition, which concerned the ſecurity of the Catholique Religion in the <hi>Val<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

His Majeſty clearly declared unto him, that the Intereſts of State and Religion were not to be mingled, and that he would never grant any thing that might impair the Soveraignty of the <hi>Griſons,</hi> his Allies, over the <hi>Valtoline.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A while after he cauſed a conference to be had betwixt him, and the Miniſters upon that ſubject, where having made the ſame propoſition, the Cardinal delated
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:56802:46"/>hmſelf upon the reaſons of the Kings anſwer, and told the Legat, that his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty having taken the protection of the <hi>Griſons,</hi> he could not conſent to the dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition of their Soveraignty, eſpecially ſince it had been conferred unto them by the Treaty of <hi>Madrid,</hi> ſince which time nothing had been altered in point of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion: That the Treaty was to be obſerved, and that his Majeſty could not depart from it without ſtaining his Honour and Reputation; offering notwithſtanding his authority to give all ſort of ſecurity and freedom to the Catholique Religion. The Legat then declared the Pope was Head of the Church, and could not ſuffer that the <hi>Valtolines</hi> ſhould he reduced under the dominion of the <hi>Griſons,</hi> and that his Holyneſs having conſulted with ſome of the Clergy at <hi>Rome,</hi> they had told him, that in conſcience he could not conſent thereunto.</p>
                  <p>The Cardinal was not wanting to tell him, that the divine Laws did oblige the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delivery of that which did juſtly belong to a Soveraign, of what Religion ſoever he be; ſo there could be no ſcruple of conſcience for the reſtoring of the <hi>Valtolines</hi> to the <hi>Griſons,</hi> their lawful Maſters, and that in effect the Treaty of <hi>Madrid,</hi> by which it was granted to them, had been approved of at <hi>Rome</hi> by the Pope, as alſo the ſayd Treaty had not been reſolved on, but after a conſultation with the Clergy, who found no difficulty in the thing, and that the truth being ſtill the ſame, his Holyneſs had not any reaſon to be ſcrupulous of it at this preſent.</p>
                  <p>This the Cardinal ſpake ſo ſmartly, that the Legat perceived that there was no more to be expected in that particular; ſo that from that time forward they were finding out new waies for the ſecurity of Religion; yet ſtill declaring, he would not recede from his firſt Propoſals, but under the Pope and holy See's cenſure. He propoſed ſeveral Articles upon that ſcore, to which the King aſſented; That leaving the Soveraignty to the <hi>Griſons</hi> which lawfully belonged to them, there ſhould be ſuch proviſion made for the ſafety of the Catholiques in the <hi>Valtoline,</hi> that the <hi>Griſons</hi> ſhould give them full liberty for the exerciſe of their Religion; that they ſhould not ſend any Governours amongſt them, but ſuch as were Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques; that all degrees both Secular and Regular might inhabit there with all kind of Freedom; that no Heretiques, or their Adherents ſhould buy Houſes, nor that thoſe who had then any in poſſeſſion, ſhould any longer live there, or enjoy their goods but onely in the behalf of Catholiques. To be ſhort, that there might be a perpetual eſtabliſhment of the whole buſineſſe, his Majeſty promiſed to become pledge for the <hi>Griſons,</hi> and to perſwade them to conſent to the utter loſs of their Soveraignty in the <hi>Valtoline,</hi> in caſe they ſhould break the conditions, of which the Pope and his Majeſty were to be joynt Judges. Nothing more could be deſired. But however the Legat, whether it were becauſe he was ſomwhat cautious, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, or becauſe he had not as yet any great experience in buſineſſes of impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, or whether it were by reaſon of his Inſtructions from the Pope, which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure might be limited, was very fearfull to engage himſelf to any thing in which he ſuſpected he might be diſclaimed; and more eſpecially ſeeing Count <hi>Gon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damor,</hi> the Spaniſh Ambaſſador, then at Court, declared openly, that he was prohibited by his Maſter to meddle or make in the Treaty; for that his Catholique Majeſty would never treat at all untill thoſe places were reſtored into his Holyneſs's hands. The King had no great reaſon to be ſatisfied with this manner of the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat's proceeding, ſeeing he every day created new difficulties. It was well known that the Orders which he received from the Pope, was one cauſe of it. His Holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs apprehending that in caſe he ſhould conſent to the delivery of the <hi>Valtoline</hi> to the <hi>Griſons,</hi> the Spaniards would diſable the Counſel, in regard ſeveral of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Clergy were of opinion, that he could not with a ſafe conſcience allow of it, as alſo the continual ſuggeſtions of the Spaniards, did mightily moleſt and trouble him.</p>

The King preſſed him, but he inſtead of facilitating the buſineſs, ſtood firm to his firſt demands: to which he was anſwered, that his Majeſty had conceded as much as could be reaſonably expected, ſo that he might not hope for any further condeſcending to them. Whereupon the Legate on a ſudden reſolves to return to <hi>Rome,</hi> and having publick Audience on the two and twentieth of <hi>September,</hi> hee took leave of the King, giving him great aſſurances of his Paſſion for the ſervice of his Crown. His Majeſty likewiſe teſtified to him, that he had a great kindneſs to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his Perſon, a great reſpect for his Holineſs, and an extraordinary devotion for the Holy Chair.

                  <p>GOD hath eſtabliſhed two ſorts of Powers, for the Government of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, and he hath had ſo great a care over mans vanity (as the learned <hi>Hino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar,</hi> writing to <hi>Carloman,</hi> and the Biſhops of <hi>France,</hi> ſaith) that to the intent hee might preſerve them in obedience, hee would totally ſeparate and diſtinguiſh the Functions of their reſpective Authorities. The Perſons who have their powers are ſubject reciprocally each to the other, Kings to Eccleſiaſtiques, and Eccleſiaſtiques to Kings, yet not that their Powers have a reciprocal dependance upon one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. It is true, the Spiritual is ſuperior to the Temporal, according to the order of dignity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but not according to the rule of Subjection and Authority; inſomuch, that who is indued with it, may not deſpoil Soveraigns of their Temporal Power nor moderate it. It is very neceſſary to diſtinguiſh between the Subjection of Perſons, and that of Powers; for though Jeſus Chriſt hath reſolved that all perſons of the World ſhould be ſubjected to his Miniſters, and all his Miniſters to Kings; yet hee hath not ordained that theſe two Powers ſhould be ſubject in the ſame manner; but he hath given to them both an equal Authority to diſcharge their Functions, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out beſtowing on either power to deſtroy the other.</p>
                  <p>Which being ſo, the head of the Church may not aſſume to himſelf any other Quality with Temporal Princes, but of a Mediator to end their differences. He hath Power indeed over their Conſciences, but not over their Eſtates, or that Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority which they have received from God for the government of them. It is to no purpoſe for him to ſnatch away the Scepter out of their hands, and whatever Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal he ſhall make to them, can be received but as Councels. It is Glorious for him, as we have ſaid, to accommodate differences, but he may not pretend to do it by his Authority: Out of zeal he is bound to fore-caſt the difficulties which he may meet with, in the perſwading both Parties to agree to his Propoſals; ſeeing thoſe which are commonly made to two Princes at Enmity, are like a Medicine which ought to be adminiſtred to a perſon whoſe Liver is very hot, but his Stomack extreamly cold and weak; for the ordering of which, the Phyſitian findeth himſelf much puzzeled, by reaſon of thoſe remedies which refreſh the one, are commonly ſtark nought for
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:56802:47"/>the other. And thus it is ſeldome or never ſeen, that thoſe Propoſitions which are made by Arbitrators do pleaſe both parties. The higheſt point of Prudence in this caſe, is to imitate the diſcreet Phyſitian, who cannot bring to paſſe his intent of cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his Patient, but by preſcribing to him ſuch things as may comfort one, and not annoy another part; for thus it is, unleſſe thoſe Propoſitions which a Mediator ſhall lay down, bee weighed with Juſtice; Equality, and Moderation, they will rather provoke, then allay the angers of thoſe Princes who are concerned in them.</p>

                  <p>ALthough it were not very needfull to take any further advice for a reſolution to thoſe Propoſitions made by the Legate, ſo evidently diſ-advantagious were they to <hi>France</hi> and her Allies; yet it was not thought amiſs to call a Chief Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, where the chief Lords of the Court, and the principal Officers of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, might underſtand the true ſtate of the caſe; and to prevent that the keeping of it ſecret, might not give the Spaniard the liberty of reporting over <hi>Europe,</hi> that Cardinal <hi>Barbarine</hi> had made very reaſonable Propoſals of Peace; but that the King had abſolutely refuſed them, by which he did declare his reſolution of continuing the War. Which was not onely clear contrary to the Truth, but againſt the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour was due to the Kings Juſtice, which had ever induced him to ſettle Peace among his neighbours, when he might do it without offence to his Reputation, or the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts of his Allies; as alſo in regard of the great reſpect which he had ſhewed to the holy Sea upon this very occaſion, as alſo in all others which preſented them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, ſo that it was not reaſonable to let his glory lie under ſuch a blemiſh. Now the onely way to ſecure it, was declaring the whole Paſſage before a Councel, where ſhould be the major part of all the Nobles; and the Cardinal perſwaded the King, that they ſhould be aſſembled in his Majeſties Preſence. They who received this command, were carefull to be there accordingly: and the Councel being met, the King told them, that he had cauſed them to be called thither, to conſult on the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs which might relate to the Publick good, upon ſuch Propoſals as the Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour ſhould make unto them, who beginning at the Treaty made with the Griſons, and renewed from time to time, by which they tied themſelves to give a free paſſage thorough their Countries at all times, for his Majeſties Armies to go into <hi>Italy;</hi> as alſo, not to accord the ſame to any other, without his permiſſion, ſhewed at laſt to them, how the Spaniard to the prejudice of theſe Treaties, had ever indeavoured by fair and foul means, to procure the ſame Paſſages might be granted to himſelf, to further his intended Conqueſt of the reſt of <hi>Italy,</hi> as occaſion ſhould invite him to it; to which purpoſe he had uſurped the Forts of the <hi>Valtol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>nes,</hi> and that his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty for the recovery of them, had been conſtrained to ſend the Marqueſs <hi>de Coeu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vres</hi> thither with an Army, that before his Majeſty had made uſe of any force<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> hee had conſented that the places ſhould be depoſited in the Popes hands, for a certain time, and upon certain conditions; which conditions being accompliſhed, and the limited time expired, the Spaniards had however found means to perſwade the Pope to retain them yet longer, though of right he ought not ſo to do, for that they were onely depoſited with him. That his Holineſs had been often urged to return them unto the Spaniard, and that his Holineſs had moved them to receive them, which they had refuſed to do, for that they eſteemed them more ſecure in his Holineſſes, then in their own keeping: After which his Holineſs being unwilling to diſſeiſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of them, the Marqueſs <hi>de Coeuvres</hi> was forced to enter upon them by ſtrength of Arms: That but very lately the Spaniards had alſo induced his Holineſs to ſend his Legate, to try if he could obtain from his Majeſty, out of the reſpect which he did bear to the Holy Chair, that he would ſurrender up the Forts again to his Holineſs, and ſuffer the Griſons to be deprived of their Soveraignty of the <hi>Valtoline.</hi> That
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:56802:48"/>theſe Propoſitions ſeemed to be ſo much the ſtronger, in regard it implied, that his Majeſty muſt give way to the Griſons (who were his Allies) loſing of that which was their indubitable right: That his Majeſty had ſtill indeavoured to preſerve them by the ſtrength of his Arms, and to ſurrender up into the Popes hands all that did not belong to them. But that to return all, which did belong to the Griſons could not be done, unleſs to the great prejudice of the Griſons, to the advantage of the Spaniards, and to the abſolute loſs of his Majeſties Reputation. That it was upon theſe Propoſals his Majeſty did deſire their advices, to know whether it were fitter to condiſcend to them, or to continue the War; deſiring every one of them to ſpeak freely what he thought proper to be done, that a concluſion might be had and ſent to the Legate, who would not ſtay to take along with him the Reſult of this Councel though he had been importuned to it; but however, he had promiſed to expect it at <hi>Avignon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Marſhal <hi>de Schomberg</hi> took hold of the diſcourſe, and amongſt other things told them, That having ſeveral times been by his Majeſties command to treat with the Legat, he had ſmelt out, that his deſigns were alwaies in the Spaniards behalf, as much as poſſible could be, of which there needed no other proof, then the two Propoſitions which he had made to deprive the <hi>Griſons</hi> of their Soveraignty, and to reſtore the Forts to the Pope, that the Spaniards might gain time to draw their Forces together, and retreat them, and his ſudden departure after he had been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed, though it had been as ſhamefull for the King to have granted them, as it had been hurtfull to the Griſons to have indured it. That for his part he was of opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on rather to reſolve on the War, and that for divers reaſons, which he there alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, which teſtified as much Courage as Prudence, then to make a diſhonourable Peace, by aſſenting to Propoſitions contrary to the Honour and Juſtice of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty. The chief Preſident of the Parliament of <hi>Paris,</hi> ſpeaking in the name of all the Officers of the Soveraign Courts, ſaid onely thus much, that the King had ever made ſuch good choice of able worthy Miniſters, that it would bee a peece of Prudence to follow their opinions, and particularly, that he thought what the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhal <hi>de Schamberg</hi> had ſaid, was very juſt and reaſonable.</p>
                  <p>The Cardinal <hi>de Sourdis</hi> was of a particular opinion by himſelf, and propoſed for the Ceſſation of Arms, alledging the inconveniency of the ſeaſon: But they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering it as a thing which was earneſtly deſired by the Spaniards, onely that they might get time, and draw their Forces together both in <hi>Italy</hi> and the <hi>Valtoline,</hi> it was hearkned to but by a very few perſons, nor ſeconded either by the Cardinal <hi>de la Valette,</hi> or the Marſhal of <hi>Baſſompierre,</hi> who were both of them well acquainted with the Spaniards Intereſts and deſigns, the one by his being at <hi>Rome,</hi> and the other in <hi>Spain;</hi> &amp; ſo delivering their opinions againſt him, carried it in concluſion for the war. The Cardinal that he might give them the more liberty to ſpeak freely, with-drew a little aſide, and comming near the King, teſtified to him how much he eſteemed Peace: That it was his opinion alwaies to prefer it before War, if it could be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained with ſafety to his Majeſties honour and reputation, and without hazarding the good of the Kingdome, which was inſeparably united with that of his Allies: But that he perceiving nothing in the Legates Propoſals, which did not undermine both one and t'other, and which onely deſigned the procuring of Glory and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages to the Spaniard, and which tended to the ruine both of <hi>France</hi> and his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, or the detriment of his Allies, he could not ſubmit his thoughts to Peace. That for his own particular, he was more againſt it; for that every one who had never ſo little acquaintance with the affairs of <hi>Spain,</hi> well knew, that their chief drift in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the <hi>Valtoline</hi> out of the Griſons Power, was onely that they might bring what Troops they had a mind to into <hi>Italy,</hi> and that by this means they might become Maſters of it: That this their deſign was of no ſmall importance to the Crown of <hi>France,</hi> which would have ſomewhat to do, to defend it ſelf from his Arms, if he could once bring it to paſſe. For a place once taken on the Borders, will ſerve the enemy to fortifie himſelf and ſtrengthen againſt him. After this, he gave his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty to underſtand, that he was not ignorant of the many difficulties which would
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:56802:48"/>ariſe for the continuance of the War, and that peradventure the Rebellion of the Hugonots might divert the ſending of ſome part of the Power of <hi>France</hi> into the Alps. But he added, that the Reputation of a King being to be preferred before all things; for that once gone neither his Authority nor his riches, nor his Arms would be regarded: he was of opinion, and it ſeemed moſt expedient to him, that the War ſhould be continued for the preſerving his Crown in its luſtre, rather then conclude a Peace, upon ſuch ſhamefull Conditions, as thoſe which had been propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the Legate. That his Majeſty ſhould ſend ſuch recruits, as ſhould make his Army be feared. That the Super-intendents would aſſure his Majeſty, he had Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure enough for the diſcharging of four Muſters, without touching any thing of the preſent Incomes. That the Clergy offered ſix hundred thouſand Crowns as a Contribution towards it. That the Hugonots were ſo abaſed by thoſe ſignal Vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories which his Majeſty had obtained over them that they could never riſe again, and that ſeeing every thing did thus contribute to the carrying on of the War, it was his advice to conclude on it, before any other thing whatever. After he had ended, no one ſpake any more, judging that there could not bee any other thing worth further Conſideration in the buſineſſe, ſo the King told them he would give notice of their Reſult to the Legate, and intirely proſecute what had been then and there concluded.</p>

                  <p>WHat ever great parts a King or his Miniſters may have either by nature or experience; yet he ought not to ateempt any important affairs; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if they carry any danger along with them, without aſſembling the Grandees of his Kingdome, and conſulting with them on it. This I think to be profitable not onely for the good of the State, but alſo becauſe it cannot be doubted, but that Counſel hath been ever found and adjudged by wiſe men, to bee the moſt aſſured ſtay, not onely of Kingdomes but of particular families. <hi>Saluſt</hi> writ to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> that not onely Kingdomes but private Towns too, injoyed proſperity, whileſt good Counſels were in force; and that nothing but miſ-fortunes had befallen them, after that compliance fear, or pleaſure had been introduced amongſt them: Not that a Soveraign is bound to reſolve with a great number of Councellors, of what he ſhould do, but I ſay he ſhould deliberate with them, and afterwards reſolve with his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, what is fitteſt to be done. He need not fear, that in ſo doing he doth diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver any weakneſs, or inſufficiency for that he is bound to it, by the very Lawes of Prudence, &amp; it is argument enough of his ability if he ground his reſolution upon the advices and conſultation of ſeveral perſons. Though the Sun be cloathed with a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull brightneſſe, which raviſheth the eye to behold it; yet God hath not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden the Stars from partaking of the government of the Univerſe; becauſe they have particular Influences which though inferiour to thoſe of the Sun, yet do they not ceaſe to be uſefull for the perfection of the World: Juſt ſo too, though Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellours who are called to deliberate on Affairs, may not be compared for under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding or Soul, with the King or a grand Miniſter; yet as the Earth brings forth ſeveral Plants which are particular and proper to it, ſo their apprehenſions and minds may be repleniſhed with ſuch thoughts, as would not perhaps have fallen under the conſiderations of others; and yet do not for all this become leſſe uſefull or unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable to the common good. But beſides this Conſideration is it not evident, that Councel is neceſſary to be taken by a grand Miniſter, if only for his diſcharg? The moſt part judge of Advices by the Events, though no rule can be more uncertain, whence it happens, that if any one alone ſhall pretend to adviſe his Soveraign, and things fall out contrary to expectation, hee will bee infallibly blamed for it: And in caſe there be no great difficulty in affairs, yet it were not amiſs to do ſo, for the ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of the Grandees of a Kingdome. Grandees for the moſt part, though ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry expert both in Politick and Military Affairs, are of ſuch a humour, that nothing will like them, nor no Reſolution pleaſe them, unleſſe they have a hand in it, and
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:56802:49"/>they will be moſt commonly ſure to work advantages againſt that Miniſter, who ſhall have perſwaded his Soveraign, if the Affairs fall out otherwiſe then was expected. They are of the ſame humour, as <hi>Cornelius Tacitus</hi> ſaith <hi>Cornelius Lacon</hi> was of, who being Captain of the Emperour <hi>Galba's</hi> Guards, was an enemy to all Counſel how good ſoever, if it came not from himſelf. Nothing can be more proper to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend a mans ſelf from this blame which is ſometimes very troubleſome, as alſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant to ones fortune, then ſometimes to aſſemble an extraordinary Councel, when there is any queſtion doth ariſe: As once when the Spartan Embaſſadours came to <hi>Rome,</hi> accompanied with a certain Captain, whom <hi>Porus</hi> had ſent to give a true accompt of the affairs in <hi>Armenia,</hi> though it was not at all needfull to call any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Councel to reſolve on the War, for that the condition of Affairs did oblige to it; yet <hi>Nero</hi> called the Principal men of the Town together, as <hi>Tacitus</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth it, and deliberated with them, whether it were more proper to run the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of a doubtfull War<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or make a Peace with the Enemy; where it was unanimouſly concluded to carry on the War, and not a man of the contrary opinion.</p>

                  <head>The Deputation of the <hi>Valtolines</hi> towards his Holineſs.</head>
                  <p>IF thoſe Propoſals made by the Legate were repugnant to the Glory of <hi>France,</hi> thoſe which the <hi>Valtolines</hi> Deputies made at <hi>Rome,</hi> to his Holineſſe, and the <hi>Sieur de Bethune,</hi> were abſolutely unjuſt. The Spaniards had excited and wrought the Catholiques of thoſe Countries upon the ſcore of Religion, to offer the Soveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to his Holineſs, and to declare by their Deputies to the <hi>Sieur de Bethune,</hi> that it was not to be hoped they would ever ſubmit themſelves to the Government of the Griſons, a thing they could not do with their Conſciences. They alſo framed a long diſcourſe, in which they pretended to ſhew by many reaſons, that the two Crowns of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> not being able to agree upon the Intereſt and Right which either pretended in thoſe Countries, there could not be a more proper, more plauſible or juſt expedient found out, then to put themſelves into his Holineſs hands, who treating the two Kings as a common Father, might grant them paſſage, as it ſhould ſeem beſt unto him, and when hee ſhould find it proper for the good of Chriſtendom. This diſcourſe conducing to the Popes Intereſts, did not a little ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate his thoughts, and he had made no great Bones to conſent to it, had not the <hi>Sieur de Bethune</hi> once and again dexteriouſly hinted to him a reaſon which could admit of no reply, which was this, That the <hi>Valtolines</hi> could not with Juſtice aſſume the liberty of putting themſelves under the domination of any one whoever he were, they being born true and natural Subjects to the Griſons, and that the King his Maſter would never give way to it. He well knew, that to put the <hi>Valtoline</hi> into the Popes hands, would be the ſame thing as if they were given up to the Spaniard, for that the Popes are either by affection or fear, more inclined to the Spaniard then to the French. But it was very ridiculous to ſee the Artifices which the Deputies did uſe to perſwade the <hi>Sieur de Bethune,</hi> that the Propoſal they had made was for the Kings advantage. They ſeveral times proteſted to him, that they themſelves and all the reſt of the <hi>Valtoline,</hi> did bear ſo great a ſubmiſſion to his Majeſties judgment, that they would wiſh for nothing elſe, but onely that his Majeſty would paſs his word for the Griſons accommodation, which if he would, they would then do what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he would command them. But in concluſion, they added that his Majeſty would be pleaſed with their reſolutions of neither ſubmitting themſelves to the Gri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons or Spaniards. Becauſe they evidently knew, there would be little ſecurity or advantage to the French, either in one or t'other of theſe expedients; withall, that to oblige them to come under the Griſons, were to force them to flie to the Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards, which if his Majeſty ſhould do, they muſt of neceſſity run to them for aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; for that they could not truſt themſelves under the Dominion of the Griſons, for that there was not any other Prince neer them, from whom they might receive a more ready or favourable relief. That they would full willingly have deſired his Majeſty to protect them; but that they doubted it would be a means to ingage his
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:56802:49"/>Majeſty in a perpetual War in their Country againſt the Spaniard, who would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver conſent to it; and that all theſe conſidered, there could not any other party be found out more proper or fit then the Pope, and that <hi>France</hi> had ſome reaſon to accord to it, in reſpect that the Pope ſhewed himſelf very favourable to the French Intereſts. The <hi>Sieur de Bethune,</hi> anſwered them with Civilities, nothing inferior to theirs, aſſuring them of the affection, which his Majeſty did bear to their concerns, and obliging them to be confident he would never abandon them, and that his Majeſty would never conſent to any Peace, by which they ſhould not have a full and perfect Freedom for the exerciſe of their Religion: But as to the ground-work of the buſineſs he diſcovered to them, that in caſe they could find a means to be aſſured of this Liberty, that then they had no reaſon to exchange Maſters; and eſpecially, ſeeing they were not in a condition to diſpoſe of themſelves. He open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly profeſſed to them, That his Majeſty did not pretend in the leaſt to the Supream Power over them, but that his reſolution was to preſerve them to the Griſons, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing to them full Liberty for the free exerciſe of their Religion, and that he would never conſent the buſineſs ſhould be ended upon other terms. This anſwer was both reſolute and full of Juſtice; but however, as Paſſion takes away the uſe of Reaſon, ſo they ſeemed not to apprehend the reaſonableneſs of it; as alſo they thought good, That the Spaniards ſhould cauſe a ſecond diſcourſe to be writ, by a Prelate of <hi>Milan,</hi> in which they indeavoured to clear by ſeveral reaſons, which were willingly aſſented to by the Pope. That the King had no right in the <hi>Valtoline</hi> to hinder their giving up themſelves to the holy See, ſo unjuſt and unreaſonable is the inconſiderate zeal, into which men do ſometimes ſuffer themſelves to be carried for Religions ſake.</p>

                  <p>ZEal is a Paſſion very commendable, when it is confined within the limits of knowledge and Charity; but without this it paſſeth onely for an unreaſonable fury, not a vertue. The Apoſtle would have it accompanied it with theſe two quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and judgeth it to be blame worthy if without them. Indeed it is like Oyl caſt in the Fire, it provoketh and raiſeth up ſuch heat in their Courages, that it hurries them, both beyond Reaſon and Juſtice. That people which knoweth not how the ſon of God hath commanded to honour all Kings of what Religion ſoever they be, as they who are eſtabliſhed by his hand, of which himſelf ſhewed an example, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo his Apoſtles do animate themſelves with an indiſcreet zeal, for the Intereſts of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; if they follow any wayes contrary to them, they do eaſily ſuffer themſelves to be hurried on to ſhake off the yoke of Obedience to take up Arms to reſiſt them, to conſpire againſt their perſons, to ruine all with Fire and Sword, and to over run the whole land with thoſe miſ-fortunes which ever attend on Civil Wars. This is that which made the learned <hi>Origen</hi> to ſay, the zeal of God is nothing worth, if it be not accompanied with the knowledge of God, introducing the Jews for an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, who by an inconſiderate zeal for Gods glory, made themſelves culpable of the moſt horrible Sacriledge that ever was yet heard of againſt his Son. I ſhall add onely this, that ſuch a zeal is not onely unprofitable for Gods ſervice; but alſo ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry dangerous and prejudicial to the good of thoſe States and Churches where it is, by that heat of it which hurries on to extremities, and ſerves for a Torch to kindle Civil Wars, which undermines the Foundations of States, and Religion it ſelf, and furniſheth them whom it poſſeſſeth with pretences for the doing of any thing, which Fury it ſelf can be capable of.</p>

                  <p>VVHileſt the Legate was at Fountain <hi>Bleau,</hi> the Embaſſadour of <hi>Holland</hi> came thither upon very different thoughts he onely deſigning to bring things to a peaceable concluſion; but they to ingage the King in an Offenſive and Defenſive War againſt the Spaniards, and deſire him to fall in upon their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries. There had been a Defenſive League made with them the fore-going year, which was ſufficient to entertain all the Spaniſh Forces in thoſe Countries, and to give advantage to the States to make ſome further progreſs. But as it is troubleſom to continue a War any long time, without obtaining ſome Victories, they having lately loſt the Town of <hi>Breda</hi> for want of good Conduct, made it their earneſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to the King that he would declare a War againſt the Spaniards, that they might be revenged on them, The Embaſſadour repreſented to the King and the Cardinal that the States Signiories and Lordſhips, were not the onely places the Spaniards had deſigned to invade, but that <hi>France</hi> too was compriſed in the ſame deſign; that the attempts which they had made but lately in <hi>Germany,</hi> in the <hi>Valtoline,</hi> and in <hi>Italy,</hi> were onely to make ſure of the out-skirts, that they might afterwards with the more eaſe make themſelves Maſters of <hi>France:</hi> That he would not enter into any further proof of it, ſeeing he was aſſured it could not be unknown either to his Majeſty or his Niniſters; onely he beſeeched his Majeſty to conſider, that it was more proper to go find them out in their own Quarters, then to ſtay untill they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred upon theirs. That that which gave them ſo great advantage in their Conqueſts was becauſe none had attempted any thing on them, every one keeping himſelf up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the defenſive poſture, but that when any thing ſhould be attempted on them, the Palms of their Victory would ſoon be ſnatched out of their hands; that they are not really ſo potent, but onely becauſe they dare affault the whole World, and that they have the Courage to fall on others, becauſe none fall on them: Which was too evident to be doubted, That it was impoſſible to let them any longer follow the courſe of their Victories, without being a Trophee for their Arms. He did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite and ſtir up his Majeſty upon the ſcore of Glory, repreſenting to him the lives of <hi>Cyrus, Hannibal, Alexander, Caeſar,</hi> and divers illuſtrious Roman Captains, who had been eternized and made famous by invading of their enemies.

Their Artifices were ſo great, that nothing more could be wiſhed for, onely that he would imbrace the deſign. He alledged that <hi>England</hi> would Potently aſſiſt it, That <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> being ſubjected under the Spaniſh Yoak, would gladly be delivered out of it, and would be induced to do any thing which might tend that way; and that for the expence there need no great care be taken for it, ſeeing the French Souldiers were not harder to be pleaſed then thoſe of <hi>Hannibal,</hi> who being asked upon his putting off from <hi>Affrica,</hi> with what he would pay his Army, anſwered with the Army it ſelf; for as ſoon as ever he ſet foot in <hi>Europe,</hi> the Ayr, the Earth, the Fire, and all the Goods of thoſe who inhabited it, ſhould be common to them; and in the progreſs of that affair, he made it evident that he was not miſtaken; for during eighteen years that he maintained War both in <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> he never received any Supplies from <hi>Affrica.</hi> The moſt part of theſe reaſons were ſo true, and the reſt ſo ſpecious, that the King muſt needs have wanted Courage, had he not been perſwaded with them; and eſpecially-ſeeing his Majeſty had often ſpoken to the Cardinal upon this very point, and that he was ſufficiently convinced of the neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty for the Princes of <hi>Europe</hi> to aſſault the Spaniard, that they might at laſt put ſome limits to his Ambition; as alſo in relation thereunto, that he had aſſaulted him in the <hi>Valtoline,</hi> by ſtopping the progreſs of his proceedings. But on the other ſide, his Majeſty was not ignorant, that thoſe enterprizes which he had already commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:56802:50"/>were very great, conſidering in what condition <hi>France</hi> then was, and that it would be difficult to undertake any more, untill the Hugonots who took advantages of his Wars abroad, and who ſtayed part of his Forces at home to keep them in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience were totally ruined. That withall it were abſolutely needfull, before any thing could be attempted on <hi>Flanders,</hi> to imploy the Arms of the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> and to ſecure the Paſſages, by which releef might be ſent to them, ſo that it might be impoſſible for them to hinder the Conqueſt of it. His Majeſty relying on the Advices of the Cardinal kept himſelf off from ingaging himſelf in this ſame offenſive League: And the Cardinal took upon himſelf the trouble of making the States Embaſſadour underſtand the reaſons of it, who found them ſo ſtrong that he had not a word to reply againſt them; but the King deſired the State to be aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that he would never be deficient in ſending them men and monies, according as hee had promiſed by the Treaty of Alliance; as alſo; that when a fit oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of Time ſhould preſent it ſelf for the taking of any advantage, he would moſt certainly ingage in it, for that his own glory and their good way inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſſed in it.</p>

                  <p>IT is a ſmall matter though a Soveraign have a generous reſolution, which leadeth him to make War, if he have not diſcretion to chuſe a fit opportunity for the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of advantages upon his enemies. It is not alwaies ſeaſonable to take up Arms, and to make Leagues or to break Peace. Before a deſign be attempted, it ſhould firſt be known whether it be ſure, profitable, and honourable, and if it may be effected with little or no hazard to the perſon who adviſeth it, and whether he runs any part of the danger, and above all it would be known, and that exactly too of what force the enemy is, what ſuccour he doth expect, the diverſions which he hath in other places, the advantages which he may have in Combats, by what wayes thoſe Troops muſt paſſe which come to defend him, from whence he may draw Proviſions for his Army; and in ſhort, all the particular eſtate of the enemies Affairs. A War ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ought to be begun, but with Prudence, that it may be ended with advantage. A reſolution ought not to be taken, but on the preſent State of Affairs, ballancing Reaſon with hope, comparing the preſent with paſt, and never propoſing thoſe things for eaſie, which are ſeen but by halves, otherwiſe the ſucceſſe will demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, that it was began with too much heat, and too little Prudence. The French never did ſo ill as when they broke the Peace with <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth, in the year one thouſand five hundred fifty five, in confidence of the Counſels and Promiſes of Pope <hi>Paul</hi> the Fourth, of the Family of the <hi>Cara<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

Livy</hi> ſaith, that in all his Conduct he was acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with his enemies intentions, as well as with his own. That Prince who ingageth himſelf in a War, without ſuch a knowledge ſeeks after his own ruine; and if there be any affair from which he ought to retain himſelf, certainly it muſt be when a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal is made to him, grounded on a League; for that offenſive Leagues do not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies end according to the hopes of them who are Intereſted in it. If the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize will be of long continuance, then onely the different Intereſts of ſeveral Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Princes, will force them to break off. Beſides Time, alteration of Affairs, and the Artifices of the enemy who is aſſaulted, do commonly work ſome change. In ſhort, the difference of things and Nations do breed jealouſies, and then every one retires to his own Quarter, ſo that after a great attempt, there is but ſmall ſucceſſe.</p>

                  <head>The Hugonots finding their weakneſs to their own coſts, have recourſe to the Kings Clemency.</head>
                  <p>THe ſignal Victory which his Majeſty had obtained by ſea before <hi>Rochel,</hi> and the Iſle of <hi>Ree,</hi> together with the impoſſibility whereunto the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> was reduced, of attempting any thing in <hi>Languedoc,</hi> ſo cloſely was he followed by the Marſhal <hi>de Themines,</hi> forced the Hugonots to have recourſe to his Majeſties Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency. They begged his Majeſties pardon by their Deputies, whom they ſent to him, to teſtifie the ſenſe they had of their fault, and to aſſure him of their future fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity and obedience. His Majeſty was well pleaſed with it, and the Deputies com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to him at Fonntain <hi>Bleau,</hi> about the end of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> whileſt the Legate was there, there was no kind of acknowledgements and ſubmiſſions, which they did not make; both in behalf of themſelves, as alſo of the Duke of <hi>Rohan,</hi> and the <hi>Sieur de Soubize</hi> who ſent to ſupplicate him by their particular Deputies, that he would be pleaſed to imploy them in the War of <hi>Italy,</hi> that they might teſtifie by their Paſſion to ſerve him, that there was not any danger in the Sea or Land, to which they would not chearfully expoſe themſelves, to contribute to his Glory. After they had made their ſpeeches, they preſented the Paper of their Complaints, humbly beſeeching his Majeſty to have regard to it; for that they were grounded upon ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Graces, which had been conferred on them by the Edict of <hi>Nants,</hi> and ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral other Grants. The King received it, and appointed it to be examined.</p>
                  <p>Now although the ſweetneſſe of Peace, which charmeth the mind, the Poverty of the people, and thoſe enterprizes which the Spaniard made upon the Allies of <hi>France,</hi> did generally invite all the French; to wiſh, that his Majeſty would accord to them the pardon which they deſired, yet ſome there were, who were divided in opinion, what was moſt fit to be done upon that affair; one part conceiving, that <hi>Rochel</hi> having received ſo great a rebuke, and finding themſelves without Iſland, without Sea, without Souldiers, and without Veſſels, they ought not to let ſlip ſuch an occaſion: The reaſon was, that in ſo doing they ſhould looſe a very advantagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous opportunity, to force the City by a Siege which could not hold out above ſix moneths, to demoliſh their Forts, and reduce them under the Kings obedience; which once done, the whole party of the Hugonots would be quite ruined; their other Towns diſabled to make any reſiſtance, and that thus, the Regal Authority would not onely receive a great accruement of Power, but the Church too would receive a very great benefit by it.</p>
                  <p>Theſe were the opinions of vulgar thoughts, which look on nothing but what is before them, and juſt in their noſes, but want diſcretion to look a little further; they conſidered not that it would alwaies be in his Majeſties Power to take up Arms againſt the Heretiques, ſeeing now they behaved themſelves otherwiſe then they uſed to doe, as hath been often ſeen; and that his Majeſty might eaſily keep thoſe advantages which he had upon <hi>Rochel,</hi> by fortifying the Iſles of <hi>Ree</hi> and <hi>Ole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron,</hi> and keeping a ſmall Army in Fort <hi>St. Lewis,</hi> and in the Country about <hi>Rochel,</hi> but that it would not alwaies be ſeaſonable and timely, to oppoſe the Ambitious deſign of the Spaniards upon the Griſons or the <hi>Valtoline.</hi> That the King could not without diſhonour, leave off thoſe glorious enterprizes which he had already began, and that in caſe he ſhould, it would give full Liberty to the Spaniards, to make themſelves Maſters of the <hi>Valtoline,</hi> as well as of the reſt of <hi>Italy,</hi> where they had already ſent their Armes, and had alſo ſtrongly fortified themſelves. That this affair was more important then that of the Hugonots, for that a more favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able opportunity to gain a happy ſucceſſe could not be had when one had a mind to it. Beſides that it was not ſufficient to be hurried on by an inconſiderate zeal, without any regard had to the Intereſts of the Kingdom, ſeeing that their Religion made a part of the Eſtate; and that alſo it very little concerned Religion to defer for ſome time the ruine of the Hugonots, for that War and Violence, did never yet
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:56802:51"/>conduce to their Converſion: Hereſie being like Saffron, which grows the faſter, the more it is trodden under foot, that when Heretiques have been burned, they have lived like Salamanders in the fire, when they have been caſt into the Water, they have increaſed like Fiſhes, and when their heads have been cut off, they have like Trees, put out more new branches then were taken off; ſo that there was no talk of ruining Hereſie, but onely of the Party, which was ſtil free for the King to do, conſidering the frequent grounds they gave for it; for that mutiny was naturalized in them; but that it was far otherwiſe in the affairs of <hi>Italy</hi> and of the <hi>Valtoline,</hi> which might not be abandoned but with extream great ſhame, and without ever hoping for another opportunity to root up the Spaniard, if he ſhould be now let alone to grow up and gather new ſtrength. Theſe were the important reaſons re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented by the Cardinal to the King, and which induced his Majeſty to grant a Peace to the Hugonots, that he might carry on his deſigns in <hi>Italy</hi> and the <hi>Valtoline.</hi> After the paper of their grievances had been examined, his Majeſty confirmed to them, whatever had been granted by the Edict of <hi>Nantes,</hi> granting them free Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty for the exerciſe of their Religion, in ſuch Towns where they had Churches and Church-yards, and an Act of Oblivion for any thing done in the War, but he would not conſent to the demoliſhing of Fort <hi>Lewis,</hi> as being too important for the keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Rochel</hi> in aw and obedience.</p>
                  <p>Theſe favours were accepted by the general Deputies of the Hugonots, in the name of all the Hugonot Towns, excepting thoſe of <hi>Rochel, Mountauban, Caſtres,</hi> and <hi>Milhana,</hi> who having been gained by the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> and <hi>Sieur de Soubize,</hi> and finding that their Leaders had onely obtained a ſingle pardon, without any other advantage, and without being imployed in <hi>Italy,</hi> according as they deſired, they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated his Majeſty upon other pretences, that he would be pleaſed to grant ſome time, till their two chief Officers, and thoſe four Cities, were joyned with them. The King granted to them that delay, upon condition it were not over long, who preſently ſent away the Heads of thoſe Reſolutions which had been taken.</p>

                  <p>THough the weakning of a Party in a Kingdom, which hath been long breeding, ſo that they may make no more Inſurrections, be a thing much to be deſired, yet it will not be peradventure alwaies ſeaſonable to attempt it; it is the duty of a wiſe Miniſter to take all occaſions for the doing of it, according to the ſtate of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of the Kingdom. <hi>Suetonius Paulinus,</hi> one of the moſt experimented Captains of his time, made it appear in an an excellent diſcourſe, upon the beginning of the Civil War between <hi>Ottho</hi> and <hi>Vittellius,</hi> as <hi>Tacitus</hi> reporteth it, that it would be neceſſary for <hi>Vittellius</hi> to be diligent: but that <hi>Orthoes</hi> Party would get advantage to execute their deſigne by delaying of it, until they had nothing elſe to do. The Dictator <hi>Cneus Sulpitius,</hi> after a great deal of conſideration, reſolved not to haſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en on the War againſt the <hi>Gauls,</hi> upon this reaſon, that he would not hazard any thing upon an enemy, who was every day declining, and out of his Countries too. Indeed he had endangered himſelf, had he fought when they preſſed him to it; whereas ſhortly after he might overcome them with eaſe. He which gives good ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice for the State, ought not to be blamed for it; but the diſcreet Miniſter deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth more praiſe, who not onely knows that it is not enough to conſider by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions of State, that which is juſt to be done in the Theory, but alſo that which the time permits, and complies with opportunities and neceſſity.</p>

                  <p>THough the peace with the <hi>Hugonots</hi> was not fully concluded, yet the Cardinal being informed of the neceſſity of recruiting the Army in <hi>Italy,</hi> was not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:56802:52"/>to procure his Majeſty to give orders for it. The Marquis <hi>de Vignolles</hi> was diſpatched with ſix or ſeven thouſand men: Who coming into <hi>Piedmont</hi> with his Forces, found the Siedge ſtill before <hi>Veriie,</hi> a ſmall Town upon the <hi>Po,</hi> very ſlen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly inhabited, but defended by a Caſtle built on a Rock, at the end of a little Hill, which was none of the worſt. The Duke of <hi>Ferià,</hi> drawing his Troops out of <hi>Aſt,</hi> had brought them up thither, hoping for a good ſucceſs in it: But the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> having intelligence of his reſolution, cauſed the Marquis <hi>de Saint Reyran,</hi> a Gentleman of <hi>Pruſſia,</hi> to march up within view of the Spaniards, with a thouſand Foot, and by the advice of the Marſhal <hi>de Cregny,</hi> he likewiſe cauſed his Army to advance and Incamp at the foot of the Hill, in certain Intrenchments, which were much ſtronger then the place it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>Above three Moneths were ſpent in continnual Sallies and Aſſaults. The Duke of <hi>Feria</hi> intrenched himſelf to his greateſt advantage: The Cannon thundred on the place with a great deal of fury; and having made at ſeveral times ſix or ſeven great breaches: The Spaniards did as often aſſault them, and were repulſed with a great deal of courage. They opened ſeveral Mines, one of which had ſeven mouthes, which they called the <hi>Hydra:</hi> but every day brought them ſome misfortune, ſo that they loſt more then the beſieged. In ſhort, they got not one foot of land, which was not aſſoon retaken from them. In the mean time, the ill weather began to come in, and the <hi>Po</hi> to ſwell up, which did not a little perplex them, for they were forced to quit one part of their Trenches, by reaſon it was filled with water, which brought their Battery into ſuch diſorder, that moſt of their Cannon ſtuck in the Mud, and much adoe they had to get them clear off again. Theſe diſgraces hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening to them, did much add to the <hi>French</hi> courage: So that on the ſeventeenth of <hi>November,</hi> the Conſtable, the Marſhal <hi>de Cregny,</hi> and the Marquis <hi>de Vignolles</hi> who was but lately arrived, having conſidered together what was to be done; caſt their thoughts on thoſe Forts which the Spaniards had in the Plain, and reſolved to aſſault them. The Conſtable gave orders for the attaquing of them; and the Troops being put into Battalia, they began a Combate, which laſted above three hours, with ſuch heat and ſucceſs to the <hi>French,</hi> that they carryed all the Forts in a trice.</p>
                  <p>In the interim, the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> arrived, and the enemy having drawn up three great Squadrons of Foot, and two of Horſe, came Matching up in good order againſt the <hi>French,</hi> to try if they could recover what they had loſt; but they onely retook one ſingle Fort, which was reſolved to be quitted and the night coming on, ended the Fray; in which they loſt above two thouſand men, and the <hi>French</hi> not above one hundred.

                  <p>THE greateſt Courages are bound to ſubmit to the Laws of Prudence, when there is a queſtion in hand for the attempting of any great Enterpriſe. Their Glory is not conſidered by the ſucceſſes of their Victories, or the taking of Towns, which many times have no dependencie upon them, but by their Reſoluteneſs, and Conſtancy, which they make appear without the leaſt dread, in doing all that can be done to vanquiſh. Impoſſibilities defend them from all blame when as they have done their utmoſt; for no one can be obliged to do that which is above his power.</p>
                  <p>In the making of War in a Forraign Country, it is needful (if poſſible it may ſo be done) to begin it by aſſaulting of the ſtrongeſt place firſt, eſpecially if it may not otherwiſe be taken, then by a ſurpriſe. The reaſon is clear; for what ever aſſault is made elſwhere, gives an Allarm to the whole Country, ſo that that the Prince who ſtands upon his defence, preſently claps in both Men and Ammunition into the principal place, that afterwards it will become impoſſible to ſurprize it. Let us firſt ſeize on <hi>Rome</hi> (ſaid the Enemies of the Roman Empire, in <hi>Herodatus</hi>) which is the heart and Caſtle of the Empire, and we ſhall quickly have the reſt with eaſe.

And as it's true, that the chief Head of an Enterprize having once made himſelf Maſter of the City Gates, may at his own pleaſure enter upon the whole, ſo it is likewiſe moſt certain, that he who hath once taken the chief Fortreſs, hath a curb on the reſt, ſo that he may do what he will himſelf, eſpecially if he can but ſo order his buſineſs, that he may keep it in his power.</p>

                  <head>The Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> excuſeth himſelf from accepting of thoſe Articles which were granted to thoſe of his party.</head>
                  <p>THeſe were the moſt remarkable paſſages, both in <hi>Italy</hi> and the <hi>Valtoline,</hi> during that year; but let us now return to the Affairs at home. The Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> could not be drawn to conclude a Peace without making ſome advantage by it, ſo that he deſired to be excuſed from giving his final Anſwer unto thoſe Articles which the King had granted to thoſe of his party, untill he had conferred with an
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:56802:53"/>Aſſembly which he pretended to make of the high and low <hi>Languedoc,</hi> inſomuch that his particular Intereſts and private Ambition were the cauſes which retarded the Peace. In the interim he did his very utmoſt to ſurprize ſome places in <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guedoc,</hi> either that he might get ſome advantage, whereby to make himſelf the more conſiderable, which might induce the King to give him that employment in <hi>Italy</hi> which he deſired, or ſome other favourable conditions. He made an attempt upon <hi>Tillet</hi> in <hi>Albigeois,</hi> ſending five hundred men to ſurprize it by night, but they were ſtoutly repulſed, and forced to retire. He had ſometime before cauſed the Towns of <hi>Maſdazil, Pamiers,</hi> and ſeveral others of <hi>Foix</hi> to revolt; from which places he ſent out his Scouts, who committed great havocks in the plain Country. Now the evil treating of the Country people, forced the Conſuls of ſome Towns there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts, to deſire the Marſhal <hi>de Themines,</hi> to come with his Majeſties Army to aſſiſt them, and make himſelf Maſter of thoſe Towns. Divers were of opinion, that this Propoſition ought to be rejected, becauſe admitting it ſhould be follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it would leave the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> at liberty to go whither he liſt, whom at that time the Army kept in ſuch awe, that he durſt not ſtir a foot, or attempt any new deſign. But however, the Count <hi>de Carmain,</hi> conſidering this proffer of the Conſuls, and in regard they undertook in behalf of the Towns to contribute to the charge of the War, and to refreſh the Army which was much diſtreſſed before <hi>Caſtres,</hi> he let himſelf be perſwaded by their entreaties to go and aſſiſt them, and taking ſome ſmall Forces with him, he went and fell on <hi>Calmont,</hi> a little Town near <hi>Mazeres,</hi> from whence ſeveral of the Rebels would make fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent excurſions, and pillage the neighbour Country. They endured the ſiedge onely three daies, and then finding themſelves ill handled by the Cannon, they ran away in the night, but the Marquis <hi>d' Ambres,</hi> who was not farre off with his Troop of Light Horſe, hearing the noiſe of their flight, charged them, and cut the moſt part of them in peeces. Shortly after, they took ſix or ſeven other ſmall places, ſome by ſtorm, and ſome by compoſition. They of <hi>Maſdazil,</hi> hearing of theſe ſucceſſes, began to be afraid, and ſent for a Paſs to the Army, to make their Accomodation: But the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> found a means to conveigh in ſome Forces to them, which made them reſolve to hold out, ſo that they chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged their former reſolution, and defended themſelves, which drew down the Marſhal <hi>de Themines,</hi> and the Count <hi>de Carmaine</hi> to beſiege them. On the fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth of <hi>September</hi> the Town was encompaſſed round about, and ſhortly after the Cannon made a Breach, but whilſt the Queſtion was in debate, for the giving an Aſſault, the Breach was repaired, ſo that a ſecond was made, and they within grown very reſolute, repelled the Kings Army with great loſs; and that which was worſt of all, was the Rains falling encreaſed the River, and ſo filled up the Trenches with water, that Siege was forced to be raiſed, which much troubled the Marquis; but it was ſomwhat moderated, by that advantage which the Marquis <hi>d' Ambres</hi> got over the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi>'s Troop of Light Horſe, which he killed, took, and put to flight. The Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> was much afflicted at the loſs of them, and ſeeing that the holding out of <hi>Maſdazil</hi> did not ſerve his turn, for that it would at another time be taken with eaſe, and that the could not make any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther good progreſs, he went to the Aſſembly at <hi>Milhaud,</hi> where he made thoſe of his party ſend a Courrier to the King, to accept of the Articles of Peace, which his Majeſty had granted to them. His Majeſty confirmed them, though they had rendred themſelves unworthy, by their new acts of Rebellion. But it was neceſſary ſo to be, for the better oppoſing of the enterpriſes of <hi>Spain,</hi> though <hi>Rochel</hi> was ſtill excepted, by reaſon of the little inclination they had teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied of keeping themſelves within their duty.</p>

                  <p>THE Ambition of Grandees in a State is oftentimes cauſe of many evils, and every one knows that they are the principal motives, either to begin, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue a War. There is not any exceſs into which Ambition doth not hurry them, to attain thoſe ends which they propoſe to themſelves. It loveth none but it ſelf, and it will eaſily violate all the rights of obedience, for the procuring of a happy iſſue to all their deſigns. It never makes a queſtion of the equity of any cauſe, but looketh on the advantages which will follow it, if it ſucceed well. Whence it cometh, that the firſt thing it doth, is to ſhut cloſe the eyes againſt Juſtice, that it may the more confidently begin, or continue it's deſign. They who are poſſeſſed with this ſame Ambition, never look on any thing but through a falſe glaſs, which doth ſtill repreſent things either more ſpecious, or bigger than really they are: And by this device it ſo charmeth their thoughts, that they begin to preſume, that Fortune which hath beſtowed ſome favours on them, will never forſake them. The raſh and fond confidence of their own abilities, makes them deſpiſe any fair overtures of Peace; but they ought to remember, that Fortune is like a Glaſs, which falls down when a man thinks he hath it faſt enough; and that God too, who delighteth in peace, doth often ſend down upon them, thoſe troubles and calamities which they propoſed amongſt themſelves to meaſure out to others. The Huntſman that he may take the Panther, knowing that he loveth Henbane, hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a good quantity of it up in the air, ſomewhat out of her reach, whence it happens, that ſhe having once ſeen it, never leaves off leaping and frisking up and down, untill ſhe become at laſt ſo weary, that ſhe falls down unable any longer to ſtand, and ſo dyeth on the place. May it not ſafely be ſaid, that Fortune doth the ſelf ſame thing with Grandees? And that ſhe uſeth the very ſame artifices to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy ambitious perſons? She propoſeth advantages to them, Victories and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts, but which are beyond their reach, and above their power, and knowing this to be the ſureſt way to allure their minds, and that for the obtaining of their extravagant ends, they will uſe any endeavours, or run into any raſh heady attempts, ſhe ſtill draweth them further on, untill in fine they are forced to ſink under the weight of them, and meet with their ſhame and confuſion in thoſe deſigns, where they well hoped for Honour and Glory.</p>

                  <p>IT was matter of aſtoniſhment, to ſee the Hugonots ſo reduced, conſidering the ſtrong reſiſtances which they had made againſt the King but a few years before, and thoſe great Armies which had been kept in <hi>Languedoc,</hi> all little enough to quel them. But they who will but reflect on the ſtrange alteration, which the Cardinal brought with him, will not much wonder at it. I might ſafely ſay, that the Army which he cauſed to be maintained about <hi>Rochel,</hi> was one cauſe of it, ſeeing it did in effect keep under the Country of <hi>Aunis</hi> and <hi>Poicton,</hi> that neither of them durſt to ſtir. I could likewiſe attribute thoſe effects to the ſending of thoſe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies into <hi>Languedoc,</hi> upon the firſt beginning of the year, who might be in a readineſs to fall on them, in caſe they ſhould appear, inſomuch that they had not the leaſt opportunity to doe any thing; and this is really the moſt certain preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive remedy for all Revolts. But however you may behold another Reaſon of State, which is the more conſiderable, for that it did by little and little, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being perceived, undermine the greateſt prop and force of them: The little Authority which the Miniſters, who preceded the Cardinal, had cauſed his Majeſty to take upon him, and the Licentiouſneſs which the Grandees were left at, either of running into the Hugonots party, or of abetting them, whenſoever any thing went contrary to their humours was the true cauſe of their greateſt ſtrength. The Princes would openly levy Troops to ayd and aſſiſt the revolted, and either them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:56802:54"/>would go in to them, or at leaſt lend them monyes, to make more Levyes. But now the caſe was altered, and things did not run in their former channels. This Grand Miniſter perſwaded his Majeſty to make himſelf Maſter of Affairs. His Majeſty wanted not dayly oportunities to effect it, and at laſt brought it to ſuch a paſs, that the Princes and Grandees lived very quietly, and every one of them was ſo well ſatisfied with thoſe Fav<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>urs which were beſtowed on them, that not a man of them would nouriſh a thought tending to diſ-union or combinations. Formerly the major part of them carried ſuch a ſway in matters of concern, that unleſs every thing which they deſired were granted to them, they would forthwith retire in diſcontent to their own houſes, as not thinking themſelves obliged to ſerve the King any longer.</p>
                  <p>But things began now to be carried in another way, and they began to live after another ſort, and to be ſenſible of the obligations which lay upon them to keep themſelves within the limits of Reſpect and Obedience. They now began to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it was to no purpoſe, to think to have that by a high hand, which could only be granted to them by way of Gratification. All the Parties and Factions which formerly were ſo rife, began preſently to fall back, there having been certain peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple removed from the Court, who made it their onely buſineſs to embroyl things, and like Waſps, ſucked up the beſt of the Treaſures, which they employed only in the ſowing of diſcontents amongſt the Grandees, who lived at the Kings coſts and charges, and yet did altogether rayl and quarrel with the Government. The ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king away of theſe abuſes was the true cauſe of the Hugonots weakning, who were never ſtrong, but when aſſiſted elſwhere. Thus it was apparently ſeen, that the King having overtopped them by the ſage advice of the Cardinal, they were after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards compelled to live as true Subjects in the obedience which is due from that qualification.</p>

                  <p>AUthority is the ſoul of a Kingdom: A State cannot but be happy, when he who governeth it knows how to rule as he ought, be it either in not ordaining thoſe things which are improper, or by bringing his Subjects to be obedient; ſo that as a Phyſitian endeavoureth moſt of all to comfort his Patients heart, a Miniſters ought to ſtudy no one thing more, then how to encreaſe and ſtrengthen his Maſters power and authority. But if he hath once ſuffered himſelf to be diſpoſſed of it, he hath loſt the Rudder by which he ſteered his veſſel, the yoke wherewith he kept the people in obedience, the ſplendour which made him be honoured with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, How will he be afterwards able to retain his ſubjects in their duties, ſeeing they will ſlight his Authority? And how ſhall he be able to receive reſpects from them, when as he is no longer Maſter of that which ſhould preſerve it in their ſouls? Authority is to a Soveraign the ſame thing that Light is to the Sun: And as that fair Star would not be reſpected by man without that ſplendid luſtre which dazeleth our eyes, ſo having once loſt his light, he is no longer admired or reſpected. The Princes of the Blood divide it amongſt them, and make it evident, that the diſ-eſteem and weakneſs, whereunto he is fallen, ſerveth for a footſtool to them to advance their own power. The Governours of Provinces too, they take ſome ſhare, and thus every one acteth as beſt pleaſeth himſelf; every thing is attempted without controul, and they do not fear to endeavour the getting of that by force, which they cannot by juſtice. The Publique Monies are turned aſide, the people oppreſſed, and at laſt all things brought into confuſion. <hi>Theopompus</hi> King of the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> anſwered a certain man who told him, <hi>Spa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

Which if it

                  <head>The Cardinal is extraordinary careful to make a good underſtanding between the King, Queen Mother, Monſieur, and the Princes of the Blood, and others.</head>
                  <p>AS the Tyes of Birth are but of ſmall force, if not cheriſhed with Affection, ſo the Cardinal could not be ſatisfied with ſetling the King in his Authority over the Princes, but took extraordinary pains, to continue them in a good un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding with his Majeſty. The Queen Mother was the chief of all thoſe who had the honour to be of the Royal Houſe, ſo he uſed his utmoſt power to tye her faſt to the Kings will. He did the more readily undertake this trouble, becauſe he had for ſeveral years, received ſundry teſtimonies of her favour, and he would gladly have acknowledged them by his ſervices; and it ſorted ſo happily, that it may ſafely be ſaid he did in it repay all her obligations a hundred times over; but it was no ſmal matter to be brought to paſs; for he was to combat with the Queen Mothers in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations, &amp; the jealouſies which the King had with ſome reaſon entertained againſt her. From the time that the Queen Mother had govern'd <hi>France</hi> in the quality of Regent, ſhe had not as yet renounced the Conduct of Affairs; though the care which one is bound to take for the Government of a people, be accompanied with a thouſand pricking vexations, yet ſo it is, that the ſplendour wherewith it is atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, hath ſuch powerful charms, that the diſcreeteſt ſouls, and leaſt ambitious, have much ado to defend themſelves againſt them. The knowledge he had of her inclination ſtill to conſerve that power to her ſelf, was a great impediment to his work: And the King, in whoſe hands the onely ſupream power reſides, was ſo much the more jealous of it, for that it is ordinary with Grandees to be ſuſpitious of their powers; and that with ſo much the more reaſon, for that Juſtice doth not permit that one ſhould divide the command with them.</p>
                  <p>The Cardinal meeting with things in this conjuncture, uſed his utmoſt induſtry to overcome the Queen Mothers inclinations, being aſſured that it would be after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards eaſie to diſſipate thoſe ſuſpitions of the King. He inſinuated into her ſoul with all ſweetneſs and addreſs, the truth, which ought to be the foundation of their good correſpondence, letting her ſee, that ſhe ought not to think it any ſtrange thing, that the King ſhould deſire to be Maſter, or that all Affairs were revolved by his order, for that by his birth the Laws of the Kingdom did give him that Authority which no one had any right to deprive him of. He uſed indeed his ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt addreſs to impreſs this truth in her, letting her ſee, that ſhe ought not to pretend to any part of it; That the King quitting all his ſuſpitions, would give her more then ſhe could wiſh, ſeeing he was ſo naturally inclined to pay her all manner of reſpects. The Queen Mother, who did then much eſteem of his counſels, did beleeve him, and ſhe received ſuch advantages by it, that by letting his Majeſty ſee by her conduct, that ſhe did no longer think of the Government, he reſtored her into ſo abſolute an Authority, that ſhe had all ſort of power in the management of Affairs.</p>
                  <p>This was a very great advantage, procured to her by this grand Miniſter, and which ſurpaſſed all thoſe favours which he had at any time received from her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty. The State too did not receive leſs profit by it; for that this good correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencie which united the Affections of the King, and Queen Mother, did put an end to all thoſe Cabals which had formerly divided the whole Nation, ſo that the Forces of it would not now fly out any more into parties, but remain entire, to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the Ambition of Strangers.</p>
                  <pb n="99" facs="tcp:56802:55"/>
                  <p>The Cardinal, that he might the more confirm this Union, and make it the ſtronger, perſwaded the King to take Father <hi>Suffren</hi> for his Confeſſor, who had been ſo for a long while to the Queen Mother, aſſuring himſelf that this good perſon, whoſe ſoul was ſo affectionately inclined to Peace, repleniſhed with Piety, and voyd of Ambition, being the Depoſitory of the ſecrets of their Conſciences, would not be a little conducing to the diſpelling of thoſe little ſuſpitions which might ariſe between them, and that he would have ſomwhat the more power, in regard women are naturally addicted to be perſwaded by their Confeſſors.</p>
                  <p>Next to the Queen Mother, Monſieur was the moſt conſiderable perſon in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, as alſo the moſt capable to raiſe Diviſions in the Kingdom, as many Princes of his Place and Birth had done, who not being able to ſtay for command untill the time preſcribed by the Laws both the Nature and the Kingdom, run out at the perſwaſion of thoſe who were near them, to ſeiſe on the Government. The Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal therefore was no whit leſs induſtrious to tye him too unto the Kings Intereſts. There was no great need of any extraordinary diligence to bring it to paſs, Juſtice having infuſed into him with his birth, all thoſe inclinations and diſpoſitions which were proper for him to have towards his Majeſty. All which the Cardinal very well knew.</p>
                  <p>Neither was he ignorant, That Princes of his condition are uſually carried away from their duties by thoſe who are attending near upon them; ſo that he likewiſe made himſelf ſure of the Colonel <hi>d' Ornano,</hi> who had the honour to be neareſt to his perſon, and upon whoſe advice Monſieur did more relye then any others. Now knowing that this ſoul naturally ambitious, was not to be captivated by other tyes then thoſe of Greatneſs, he perſwaded the King to beſtow on him a Marſhals Staffe of <hi>France,</hi> conceiving that this Qualification would force him to become his Majeſties very faithful ſervant. Monſieur the Prince, had the honour to be the firſt of thoſe of the Blood Royal, and the Cardinal thought it no leſſe expedient to gain him, and ſatisfie his humour, by giving him a part in Affairs, and the content which he might pretend to in his Intereſts. He had a great conflict with the Queen Mothers ſpirit, but at laſt with a handſom addreſs, he let her ſee, that there could be no certain quiet and repoſe in the State, without a good underſtanding between the King her ſon and him, and that it was to contribute to his own greatneſs, not to leave the Prince in thoſe diſcontents whereunto he had been reduced, and which might in time carry him on to the making of Cabals, and raiſing of new emotions. But whatever reaſons he could then alledge, ſhe would not be induced to aſſent to his coming to the Court; nevertheleſs the Cardinal ſo dealt with the King, that his Majeſty in ſome Letters to him, gave him extraordinary expreſſions and teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of his Favour, ſometimes by asking his advice, as occaſions ſhould preſent, as alſo by taking a particular care for the expediting of his Affairs, which was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly effected; and the King writing to him, aſſured him of his kindneſs to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him, and deſiring his opinion of the Affairs of the <hi>Valtoline,</hi> of the <hi>Hugo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nots,</hi> and the War of <hi>Italy.</hi> By this he received an entire content and ſatisfaction, ſo that from thence forward he began to order himſelf with more affection to his Majeſties Inclinations, then formerly he had done. This ſtrait union which the Cardinal tyed in the Royal Family, was an aſſured foundation of the Nations Peace, and cut off all hopes that any troubleſome ſpirits might have to embroyl it.</p>

                  <p>THat Miniſter who would attempt any great deſigns abroad, is bound to ſettle all at home, by a ſtrong uniting of the Royal houſe. The harmony of the prime Qualities is that which preſerves our bodies in a convenient health: If one ſhould aſſault the other, the Natural Juſtice is violated, and the Union diſſolved; which once ſo, the whole frame falls to nothing. Who knoweth not, that the Union of Grandees, eſpecially thoſe of the Royal Family, is the moſt ſure founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Peace and Welfare to a State? They may not be disjoyn'd from their King,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:56802:56"/>neither may any one of them attempt upon his Crown, but Juſtice will be offended, and their Union broken, which once ſo, the State is ſoon expoſed to manifold dangers and misfortunes. This was the opinion of <hi>Miſipſa</hi> in <hi>Saluſt,</hi> and <hi>Cyrus</hi> inſtructing <hi>Cambyſes</hi> his own Son, adviſed him alwaies to be in friendſhip with his kindred, and to give them ſuch advantages as may content them, becauſe it will make him be well beloved by his Subjects, who imagine that a Prince, who doth not affect his own Kindred, deſerveth not the affections of any others; and will alſo give more aſſurance to his Government, by defending him from any inſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections which might be made by them. And this is the more conſiderable, as <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citus</hi> ſaith, for that it is ordinary with the people, to have a particular affection; for the Kindred of a Prince, when they ſhall ſee them hated without any juſt cauſe or reaſon, exemplyfying the Love which the people of <hi>Rome</hi> did bear to <hi>Germani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus,</hi> which increaſed in them by the hatred which was born to him by <hi>Tiberius;</hi> and it cannot be doubted, but that the particular affection with which the people love them, may give them great advantages to embroyl the State, and may ſerve for a ſtrong prop to their revolts. It cannot be avoyded, but that Princes nearly rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to a Soveraign, muſt have ſome hand in the Government of Affairs, and muſt partake with him in the Honours of the State; how can it then be done in a good order, unleſs they live in a fair correſpondence with one another? What way can a veſſel goe, when as they who guide it, do ſome row towards the Poop, and others towards the Prow; deſpiſing the Pilots orders, ſo that the veſſel becomes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be wracked. And what may there be expected from a State, where the Princes of the Blood Royal, who have the Government of the Provinces, fall off from his Majeſties deſigns and intereſts, engaging themſelves in Factions and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties? Doth it not by this means abſolutely expoſe the State to Civil Wars, which being left at random by this diſunion, becomes a prey to ſtrangers, who will be ſure to take advantage of it?</p>

                  <p>THough the Allyance which had ſo lately been contracted with <hi>England,</hi> ſeemed to be indiſſolvable by the confirming of it with the Mariage of the Princeſs; yet it was not long before ſome grounds did ariſe to obſtruct their good corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondency. The great confidence which the Queen of <hi>England</hi> had in certain Ladies, who had been a long while near, and about her, as alſo in certain Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiques, a little too inconſiderate in their zeal, was in part the occaſion of it; for they giving her advices which were not alwaies accompanied with Prudence, did claſh with the King her Husbands humour, and were upon the point of breeding ſome differences between them. The King did not much wonder at it, having of a long time known, how little conſiderable womens counſels ordinarily are, and how they commonly end in ſome broyl, unleſs there be ſome one near them, who may prevent it by the reputation and credit which he hath amongſt them. But however it did not hinder his Majeſty from diſpatching the <hi>Sieur de Blanville,</hi> his Extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Ambaſſador to the King of <hi>England,</hi> that he might take ſome courſe before the inconſiderateneſs of thoſe perſons who were about the Queen, had cauſed any more miſchiefs; which was the eaſilier to be done, in regard the Queen want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed neither Reſpect nor Love for the King her Husband, and was onely to be bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, for having relyed a little too much upon thoſe who were given to her to be her Counſel.

<pb n="101" facs="tcp:56802:56"/>with goods to the value of twelve hundred thouſand Liuvers. This kind of acting was as ſtrange as unjuſt, and a great noiſe it made. The French Merchants not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to get a ſatisfactory anſwer in it, becauſe the <hi>Sieur de Blainville's</hi> demands were ſent to the Council of his Majeſty of Great Britain, ſeiſed upon ſome En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh Ships, which exaſperated them afreſh, and hindred the reſolution of any thing untill the following year.</p>

                  <p>ALthough the common end of private Mariages tend to concluding of Peace a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Families, yet it is not alwaies the ſame thing with Princes.

                  <head>The Treaſuries are better regulated by the Cardinals care.</head>
                  <p>THey who have had particular knowledge of things ever ſince ten years laſt paſt, could not ſufficiently wonder at thoſe vaſt charges which the State had been put to both by maintaining ſo many Armies together, in <hi>Languedoc,</hi> in <hi>Poictu,</hi> in the <hi>Valtoline,</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> as alſo in the Match with <hi>England,</hi> and defraying of Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors expences, together with Alliances with States, conſidering that the Cardinal entring upon the Adminiſtration, had found the Treaſury not onely exhauſted, but likewiſe much indebted, ſo that they lived upon the next years Revenues. This was an effect of that great Miniſters prudence, who knowing how neceſſary it was for a State to have a good maſs of Mony in reſerve, had quickly ſo ſetled the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuries, that there was great plenty ſucceeded that former want. The Secretaries of State were commanded not to ſeal any more Orders, but by expreſs command from the King or his Chief Miniſters: The Superintendants were alſo ordered, not to au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorize thoſe which ſhould be preſented from the Secretaries of State, but upon good and juſt conſideration. There were divers perſons removed from Court, who attended there to no intent or purpoſe, but only had ſometimes the honour to ſee the King. Rewards were kept for thoſe who deſerved them by their ſervices. There were alſo new orders taken at the ſame time concerning the Treaſuries, which were ſo exactly obſerved, that it was impoſſible any more to abuſe the Kings Monies as formerly they had done, ſo that the Treaſury was not only acquitted of thoſe advances which had been made, but was afterwards filled with ſuch great ſums, that <hi>France</hi> had never ſeen the like.</p>

                  <p>THe King who deſigns great matters, and wants ſtore of monies to execute them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> doth onely attempt vain enterprizes. The moſt part of Politicians have alwaies been of opinion, that the Riches of a Prince are the Nerves of War; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe as it is impoſſible for a man to go or ſtand without Sinews; ſo it cannot be expected that an Army ſhould ſubſiſt, or that Souldiers ſhould do their duties, if there be not good ſtore of monies to pay them, and to provide all neceſſaries for them. There is not onely <hi>Machiavel,</hi> who denieth this Poſition againſt the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of <hi>Dion, Quintus Curtius, Vegetius, Cicero</hi> and <hi>Plutarch,</hi> who is of opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that money is not a Nerve in War. But beſides that the Judgement of theſe great Sages of Antiquity, is at leaſt as conſiderable as his opinion. So I find not that thoſe reaſons of his are ſolid enough to overthrow ſo commonly received a maxime. I muſt confeſs with him, that War may ſometimes have a good ſucceſſe, though the Souldiers be but ill payed, becauſe the Authority of a grand Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and their own Courages may very much animate them; but as that doth but ſeldome happen, ſo there cannot be any certain concluſion deduced from it. There is hereof a notable example in the Battel of <hi>Pavy,</hi> where the Imperialiſts deſpair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to perſwade their Army to fight by reaſon they were ſo ill paid, the Marqueſſe of <hi>Peſcaire</hi> took the reſolution on himſelf to exhort them, and infuſed ſuch mettle in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, that they went on with great Courage, and got a great honour over the French. But that Prince who would deduce an abſolute Rule from this example, or any of the like nature, and ſhall follow them in his Conduct, ſhall onely prepare himſelf for his own Confuſion and Ruine: Experience having made it evident on a thouſand occaſions, that it is unreaſonable to hope for a happy ſucceſs in matters of War, though never ſo inconſiderable, without great practice. I know that it is not money onely, which conduceth to the carrying on of great exploits, but that good Souldiers are alſo neceſſary; an experienced old Commander, courteous, generous, able in Counſels, quick in executions, beloved by the Souldiers and indued with ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral other qualifications neceſſary for command: But beſides all this, though a General and Souldiers ſhould be thus accompliſhed, yet unleſſe there be good ſums of monies, nothing can be really attempted: For how can a Prince without this, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie ſeveral Souldiers and Commanders? How can he without this make his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations of Victuals, Proviſions, Ammunitions, Artilleries, and other things which cannot be had without great expences? And in caſe his Forces ſhal be cut off or deſtroyed, how can he make Recruits or new Levies? <hi>Charles</hi> the eighth having great occaſions for Souldiers to raiſe the Siege of <hi>Navar,</hi> ſent the Bayliff of <hi>Dion</hi> to raiſe it, but having no money he could procure no Souldiers. In the mean while, the King accorded with the Florentines for the reſtitution of <hi>Piſa,</hi> and ſeveral other Towns in Hoſtage, by which means he received great ſtore of monies, of which he ſent a ſmall part into <hi>Swizzerland,</hi> and the Bayliff who onely demanded ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand men, brought twenty thouſand with him.</p>

                  <p>KIngs may lawfully compel Eccleaſiaſtiques upon an important occaſion to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to them ſome part of their Revenues for the maintenance of the State, ſeeing the goods of the Church are upon ſuch neceſſities in the ſame condition with thoſe of others. They are not exempted from ordinary contributions either by the Son of God, or his Apoſtles; for when as they lived on the earth, the Church had not any immovable Goods, and it is from the favours of Emperours and Kings, that ſhe hath ſince obtained that priviledge; it was never granted to her, but only that they might be employed on the publique extraordinary neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the State. They are only tyed by Religion not to exact it, though they may by abſolute authority force it; for if they might not make uſe of the Churches Goods in a caſe of urgency, their Soveraign power would be of little worth: And Soveraigns not compelling them in this harſh manner, doe ſo much the more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige them to do it; for the entreaty of him who may enforce, is a greater tye then his command: And is it not very reaſonable, that as all the parts of the Body, even the moſt noble, do contribute to its conſervation, ſo all the members of a State ſhould doe their utmoſt to preſerve it, and to eſtabliſh the glory of it. The Emperour <hi>Gratian</hi> ordained, That every one ſhould ſerve on publique occaſions, and firſt of all addreſſed himſelf to execute it, not pretending any exemption to due to the priviledge of his dignity; and <hi>Plato</hi> ſaith, No man but ought to obey neceſſities, ſeeing the Gods themſelves ſubmit to them. And admit that Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiques ſhould deny, or make any difficulty to aſſiſt the King on ſuch occaſions, might they not with reaſon be reproached, as the Emperour <hi>Diocleſian</hi> once did a Philoſpher, who petitioned him to hold him excuſed from ſome Levy which was layd upon the reſt of the people.

                  <head>Troubles in <hi>Lorrain</hi> hapening upon the Will of <hi>Henry</hi> Duke of <hi>Lorrain.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>IT remaineth that I ſhould now write of ſome Affairs which paſſed about the end of this year in <hi>Lorrain,</hi> and which have ſuch a dependance on the concerns of <hi>France,</hi> that I may not let them ſlip. <hi>Henry</hi> Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> a little before he dyed, finding himſelf without Sons, did by his Will inveſt his eldeſt Daughter Madam <hi>Nicole,</hi> whom he had married to <hi>Charles de Lorrain,</hi> eldeſt Son to the Count of <hi>Vaudmont,</hi> his younger Brother, giving her to underſtand, that <hi>Lorrain</hi> and all that which belonged unto it, did really appertain to her, and that <hi>Charles</hi> her Husband had no right to it, but onely in conſideration of her. However the Count <hi>de Vaudmont,</hi> deſirous to preſerve it to his Son, in caſe he ſhould outlive his Wife, pretended himſelf to be heir to the Dutchee, by virtue of the Will of <hi>Rey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard,</hi> King of <hi>Sicily;</hi> and Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> his Great Grandfather, dated the twenty fifth of <hi>May,</hi> in the year one thouſand five hundred and ſix, which untill then he had never heard of; by which the ſaid King foreſeeing the ruins which u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually happeneth to great Houſes, by ſubdividing thoſe poſſeſſions which once be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to them, had incorporated the Dutchees of <hi>Lorrain</hi> and <hi>Bar,</hi> the Marqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſate of <hi>Ponta-Mouſon,</hi> and the Earldom of <hi>Vaudmont,</hi> and conſtituted his eldeſt Son <hi>Anthony,</hi> late Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> ſole heir of the ſaid Soveraignties and Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips, willing, and ordaining, that his deſcendents ſhould ſucceed him from Male to Male, gradually, and one after another, and that the Daughters ſhould not at all pretend to it. He left in diviſion to <hi>Claudius</hi> his youngeſt Son, the poſſeſſion of <hi>Guiſe, Elbauf, Aumalle, Mayenne, Joinville,</hi> and ſeveral others which he had in <hi>France,</hi> ſubſtituting and ordaining his Heirs Males for ever to enjoy them, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding all Daughters. The original of the Will was very authentique, and Copies of it in divers places to be had. There was moreover an Inſtrument of Approbation, made by the States of the ſaid Dutchie aſſembled for that purpoſe, after the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſe of the ſaid King, upon the thirteenth of <hi>February,</hi> in the year fifteen hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and eight, before Madam <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Gueldres,</hi> Queen of <hi>Sicilie,</hi> Dutcheſs of <hi>Lorrain</hi> and <hi>Bar,</hi> who declared, they were contented to conform themſelves to the ſaid Kings Will.</p>
                  <p>Now the Count <hi>de Vaudmont</hi> ſuppoſed, that upon conſequence of this ſubſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and order thus eſtabliſhed by Will, and confirm'd by the States, himſelf was the onely and true Heir of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> and that his late Brothers Daughters could pretend to it, but that they ought to be married to perſons correſpondent to their Qualities.</p>
                  <p>At laſt he declared, by a publick Inſtrument, that in conſideration of his Sons marriage with Madam <hi>Nicole,</hi> his late Brothers Daughter, he was content to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſs himſelf into the hands of his ſaid Son, and that he did inveſt him with it, requiring that he ſhould be honoured and obeyed in that quality by all his States, which he renounced to him in his behalf; and that after his deceaſe they ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend to his next Heirs Males, excluding all Females, and ſtill preferring the eldeſt, who were to give the youngeſt Penſions, and the Daughters Portions according to the Honour of the Houſe.</p>
                  <p>The King, though ſomwhat concerned in this agreement, did not oppoſe it, but eſteemed it as frivolous, it being free for him not to take any notice of it, becauſe it was not preſented to him for a ratification, though the curious ſpirits of the time, who are pleaſed to diſcuſſe the Intereſts of States, not at all concern'd in them, but onely by the faithfulneſs of their Affection, did talk diverſly of it: Some maintaining that the Will of <hi>Reynard</hi> the ſecond, upon which the Count <hi>de Vaudmont</hi> grounded his pretenſions, was abſolutely voyd, as alſo the Contract
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:56802:58"/>of diſſeiſure. They alledged for their chief reaſon, that it was contrary to the Laws and Cuſtomes of <hi>Lorrain</hi> and <hi>Barr,</hi> obſerved in the Succeſſions of thoſe Dutchies and Lordſhips which ever preferred the daughters before the Males who were far remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; and ſecondly, that it was contrary to the Laws and Cuſtomes of <hi>France</hi> made at <hi>Orleance,</hi> in the year one thouſand five hundred and ſixty, and at <hi>Moulin</hi> in one thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand five hundred ſixty and ſix, which prohibit ſuch ſubſtitutions for ever, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain them to the ſecond degree<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> Beſides the inſtitution which was paſſed, if it ſhould ſo ſtand, it would follow of conſequence, that the ſubſtitution in behalf of the Males for ever, could not be vallid, eſpecially in relation to <hi>Barr,</hi> and that which depends on the Crown of <hi>France,</hi> where his Majeſty ought to be conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, not onely as common Soveraign, but as Lord Paramout to whom belonged the cognizance of cauſes of Appeal, and to whom Faith and Homage ought to be paid, as alſo ſervice with and againſt all others, it being not allowed to a Vaſſal, to alter (without the Kings authority who is chief Lord) the nature of the Fee, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Order eſtabliſhed by Cuſtome. Thirdly, they added for the confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their opinions, an example very conſiderable which was this. It had been concluded and agreed upon in a Treaty made at <hi>Guerand,</hi> in the year one thouſand three hundred ſixty and four, between <hi>John</hi> the valiant Count <hi>de Montfort,</hi> after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Fifth of that name Duke of <hi>Brittain,</hi> ſon of <hi>John</hi> Count of <hi>Montfort,</hi> of the one party, and <hi>Jane</hi> Dutcheſs of <hi>Brittain,</hi> daughter to <hi>Guy</hi> Count of <hi>Ponthieu,</hi> elder brother to the ſaid Count of <hi>Montfort,</hi> of the other party. That as long as there ſhould be Males of the ſaid Houſe of <hi>Brittain,</hi> no Female ſhould inherit the ſaid Dutchy: They did not apprehend this Agreement to be firm and good, unleſſe <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth who was Soveraign of the ſaid Dutchy ſhould ratifie and confirm it, for that it was contrary to the Cuſtome; by vertue of which ſaid Cuſtome, the ſaid <hi>Jane</hi> had obtained the ſaid Dutchy by a ſolemn Judgement, againſt her ſaid Unckle the Count of <hi>Montfort</hi> in being preferred before him, as being the neereſt, and daughter to the eldeſt Brother; and that therefore they intreated the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſaries and Deputies, who were the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Rei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>d,</hi> to ratifie and confirm their Award, which they did: That upon the ſcore of this Ratification, the Males of the Houſe of <hi>Montfort</hi> had alwaies ſucceeded in the ſaid Dutchy of <hi>Britain,</hi> by being preferred before the Females. That <hi>Rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard</hi> the ſecond in not having followed this order, for the Dutchy of <hi>Barr,</hi> and thoſe other Lands which depended on <hi>France,</hi> had made his ſaid Will and Subſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion abſolutely void in it ſelf. Fourthly, the beſt Hiſtorians did moreover alledge, That this ſame Will of <hi>R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ynard</hi> the ſecond, was not deemed to be vallid in the Houſe of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> but had been abrogated from time to time: As for thoſe Lands which related to <hi>France,</hi> they anſwered, that the ſaid Duke himſelf had about ten moneths after, diſ-owned his ſaid Will by a ſolemn Act, whereby he beſeeched <hi>Lewis</hi> the twelfth to grant his conſent, that his Heirs Males and Females, might ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to inherit thoſe lands in <hi>France,</hi> though the ſaid <hi>Claudius</hi> was born out of the Kingdome, as may appear by the Letters of Naturalizing, granted by the ſaid King at <hi>Lyons</hi> in the year one thouſand five hundred and ſeven, in the moneth of <hi>May,</hi> preferring by this Act, the Heirs females of <hi>Claudius,</hi> before <hi>Anthony</hi> his eldeſt ſon whom he had created Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> and the ſons of the ſaid <hi>Anthony.</hi> That in Proſecution of his ſaid Deed of Abrogation, the ſaid preferrency had been gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the daughter of <hi>Claudius,</hi> in reference to the Dutchies of <hi>Guiſe</hi> and <hi>Aumal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le;</hi> as alſo in the Principallity of <hi>Joinville;</hi> in which it is declared, that the ſaid Daughters ſhould be admitted to inherit the ſaid Lordſhips and Lands, excluding the ſons of the late Duke, at leaſt from all which related to <hi>France.</hi> Sixthly they added, that as for what hath dependence from the Empire, the Will ought not to be valid, neither for that it is directly contrary to the Cuſtome received and uſed in all Principallities thereunto belonging, which are upon that ſide of the <hi>Rhine,</hi> and particularly againſt the Cuſtome of <hi>Nancy</hi> it ſelf: By vertue of which, the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters have ever ſucceeded, excluding the Males when ever they were nearer related, and that it was not in the power of <hi>Raynard</hi> to aboliſh the ſaid Cuſtome without
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:56802:59"/>the Emperours conſent to that purpoſe, firſt had and obtained. On the other ſide there were ſome others who were of opinion, that the Will of the ſaid <hi>Raynard</hi> ought to be good and vallid, there being no diſpoſing Power which can exceed a Priviledge; that it was true the ſaid ſubſtitution was contrary to the Cuſtomes, but the Soveraign Liege having power at leaſt with his States to make and to conſtitute ſuch Ordinances and Laws which might regard the good of his people; provided alwaies that the Supream Authority from whence he depended, were not injured in it, he might abrogate ſuch uſances, and that no one could pretend to oppoſe it, no not the Lord <hi>Paramount</hi> himſelf, for that he was not at all concerned in it, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting his particular Rights were preſerved to him, ſeeing as the Lawyers ſay, That whatſoever is reſolved by the States of a Country, for the reformation of a Cuſtome ought to be deemed and obſerved as a Cuſtome of it ſelf. Their main reaſons were, That it was neceſſary to diſtinguiſh between a Soveraign <hi>Paramount,</hi> and a Liege Lord; that indeed it was granted, a Liege Lord had not power to make any Orders or Laws in prejudice of his Superiour Lord, but that it is not the ſame thing as to what concerneth the Powers which appartains unto him, and that he may at leaſt diſpoſe of them with his States, not to alienate; but certainly to ſubſtitute and appoint them. That it were indifferent to a Lord <hi>Paramount,</hi> whether they were Males or Females who ſucceeded in the Government, it being not any thing of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern to him, provided his rights were preſerved to him, and that his Homage, Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and Obedience were paid him. That if at any time they ſhould oppoſe ſuch Orders and Laws as were made by a Soveraign Liege and his States, their oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on however were not of any validity, for that no one hath any right to oppoſe any thing which doth not claſh with his own Intereſts. That withall this reaſon was ſo much the more conſiderable, in reſpect of thoſe States which have depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance on the Empire; becauſe they are held with much leſſe Subjection then thoſe of the Crown of <hi>France,</hi> for that the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> is not at all obliged to pay Homage to the Emperour, but onely to ſerve him, and contribute to the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities of his State.</p>
                  <p>They alledged one very conſiderable reaſon, as to what concern'd his Majeſties intereſts, in relation to thoſe Signiors which depended on his Crown, making it apparent, that he was ſo far from being prejudiced by thoſe conſtitutions made in favour of the heirs Males, that rather on the contrary, his Majeſty would receive a notable advantage by it, ſeeing by this means, the States of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> would al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies remain in the Poſſeſſion of ſome ſmall Prince, whoſe weakneſs alone, if he ſhould at any time be minded to fall off from his Fidelity, would force him to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in his duty; whereas if the daughter were admitted to a ſucceſſion before any Males further removed, it would of conſequence fall out, that thoſe Females might fall into the hands of ſome Potent Prince, from whom his Majeſty might probably receive more diſ-ſervice then ſervice, as it happened in the caſe of Inheritrix of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> who married <hi>Raynard,</hi> it is apparently known to every one, of what great concern it is (without being beholding to examples) for a King to have ſmall Princes to be his neighbours.</p>
                  <p>As to that which concerneth the Ordinances of <hi>Orleance</hi> and <hi>Moulines,</hi> which reſtrained all ſubſtitutions made to the fourth degree; beſides the firſt inſtitution, that is to ſay, from the Inſtitutor, and the inſtituted, who ſucceedeth the inteſtate, they pretended it did not exclude <hi>Francis</hi> Count of <hi>Vaudmont</hi> from the ſubſtitution, ſeeing he was the fourth from <hi>Anthony,</hi> who was the firſt inſtituted. For this <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony</hi> left his State of <hi>Lorrain</hi> to his ſon <hi>Francis,</hi> which <hi>Francis</hi> left them to his ſon <hi>Charls,</hi> and <hi>Charls</hi> to the late Duke <hi>Henry</hi> his ſon, who was father to <hi>Nicole,</hi> which <hi>Henry</hi> having no ſons, <hi>Francis</hi> Count of <hi>Vaudmont</hi> his brother ought to be admitted to the ſucceſſion, he being within the fourth degree of the Ordinances, and that reducing Liege Princes to the condition of ordinary Vaſſals, that which is permitted to ordinary Vaſſals, ought at leaſt to be granted and allowed unto them. They likewiſe anſwered, in reply to the Treaty at <hi>Guerrande,</hi> that that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample could not prejudice the right which <hi>Francis</hi> Count <hi>de Vaudmont</hi> had to the
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:56802:59"/>ſucceſſion, for that a ſingle example createth no Law, as the Lawyers ſay; becauſe particular perſons not well informed may be defective in uſing their own rights in their utmoſt extenſion of Power.</p>
                  <p>And laſtly they ſaid it was eaſie to anſwer all thoſe Allegations brought to make void the Will, and that <hi>Reynards</hi> own Act could not nullifie it, for that no Teſtator whatever, contradicting any one Article of his Will during his life, doth at all hinder the ſtanding good of all the reſt.</p>
                  <p>Beſides that, the Ratification made by the States two years after, did ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly evince that he did not at all pretend to abrogate thoſe Lands which he had left to his ſon <hi>Anthony,</hi> and that it might ſafely be ſaid, he had onely deſired Letters of Naturalization from <hi>Lewis</hi> the twelfth, that he might make the daughters of his Son <hi>Claudius,</hi> capable of ſucceeding in thoſe Lands which he had left him, not that he did pretend by it to prefer them before the far remote Males; but becauſe it might happen in time, that they alone might remain to enter upon their Fathers Poſſeſſions, and in that caſe it would be needfull, that their Father were naturali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed to bring them into Poſſeſſion. That the ſame thing might be ſaid, in anſwer to the Dutchies of <hi>Guiſe</hi> and <hi>Aumalle,</hi> and the Principallities of <hi>Joinville;</hi> as alſo of the Treaty made between King <hi>Charls</hi> the ninth, and <hi>Charls</hi> the ſecond Duke of <hi>Lorrain;</hi> for that there was no colour of reaſon to beleeve, that the <hi>Meſſieurs de Guiſe,</hi> who drew on the ſaid Treaty, would act againſt that Will which called them into the Succeſſion of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> by excluding of the daughters, ſeeing it had not as yet been contradicted, there not having hitherto been any daughters, who could pretend to the Succeſſion of the Dutchies of <hi>Barr</hi> and <hi>Lorrain,</hi> in excluſion of the Males, but onely Madam <hi>Nicole,</hi> and <hi>Claudius</hi> of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> who were then in competition. That as to the form of renunciation made by <hi>Anne,</hi> daughter to Duke <hi>Anthony,</hi> and <hi>Chriſtian</hi> daughter to Duke <hi>Charls,</hi> they could not null the Will, for that both did proteſt to be maintained in thoſe rights which did really belong to them, which thing did not however give them any right at all. Theſe anſwers ſeemed plauſible enough, whence it followed, that thoſe exceptions made againſt the Will not being conſiderable in their Judgements, they preſently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded that the Will ought to be in its full force, and put in execution, and theſe were the reaſons alledged by both Parties; but the King could onely judge of them, as to what related to his Crown; for that he alone is Soveraign judge of all that concerneth his own intereſts, and he hath no power but God above, which can Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrate concerning it.</p>

<pb n="108" facs="tcp:56802:60"/>places. And if this priviledge of Males hath been judged heretofore reaſonable amongſt private families, it is incomparably much more in Soveraignties, where the daughters have been alwaies eſteemed uncapable by the moſt diſcreet. It is true that Liege Lords, being onely to gather the profits of their poſſeſſions are bound for the making of theſe ſubſtitutions valuable to procure the conſents of their Eſtates in whom the proptiety remains: But an abſolute Soveraign ought not to make any difficulty at all of it, becauſe it is very advantagious for them; eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally if it be done in the favour of thoſe whoſe greatneſſe is not to be ſuſpected. This will be a means to preſerve the Eſtate that belongs to him in the hands of a ſmall Prince, whoſe power he will never have any reaſon to fear, which is no ſmall ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to him, whereas letting it fall into the hands of daughters who may marry with Potent Princes, they may become their Maſters, and may not onely not ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that ſervice which is due by Liege men; but on the contrary, may bring ſuch troubles to them, as may oblige them ſtill to attend them as enemies, who may make a War upon him: It ſeemeth likewiſe to be without any ground, that he ſhould pretend a power to hinder them, ſeeing his right extend onely to the inveſtiture, to the Homage, to the Tribute, to the Service of War, and fidelity, in which he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be damaged if they are preſerved to him. Of what importance is it then, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be a ſon or a daughter, which payeth him his Homage Tribute, and other du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties as a token of ſubmiſſion. In that caſe it ought to be indifferent, for it hath onely relation to the Liege Prince, whence it comes that every one being in a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity to diſpoſe his rights, as ſhal beſt pleaſe himſelf, eſpecially when no one is preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diced by it, there can be no impediment for the ſubſtituting his eſtate in the favour of the Males. Provided he alwaies oblige them to pay that that is due to their chief Lord without great reaſon no alterations ought to be made, in fundamental Cuſtomes of Countries; and as it ſeems not to be allowable in <hi>France</hi> to abrogate the Salique Law, which excludeth the daughters from the Crown; ſo it is very doubtfull whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be in the Power of the States themſelves of ſome Countries, to change ſuch Cuſtomes as have been received there time out of mind for the ſucceſſions of Soveraigns.</p>

This was according to the temper of his Soul, who could not indure any quiet, but the Conſtable <hi>ae Lis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diguiers,</hi> and the Marſhal <hi>de Crequy,</hi> who deſired not to attempt any thing which
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:56802:60"/>might not ſort to their Maſters glory, oppoſed his deſign, repreſenting to him that there was no ſence of reaſon to aſſault the Spaniſh Army, which conſiſted of fourteen thouſand men effective, intrenched in a place very advantagious with Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, and where they might be releeved with all neceſſary proviſions, and that neither the ſeaſon nor condition of their forces, would conſiſt with the beſieging any place in <hi>Milan,</hi> without hazarding the Kings Army and Reputation. Theſe reaſons were very conſiderable, and the Conſtable without loſing any more time, and ſeeing his preſence would be needleſſe during the reſt of the Winter in <hi>Piedmont,</hi> withdrew himſelf towards <hi>Granoble,</hi> after he had put the Troops in Gariſon, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Command of the Marquis <hi>de Vignolles</hi> and <hi>

                  <p>FOr the better underſtanding in what manner this Treaty was concluded, It will be needfull to look a good way back and to take the firſt riſe of Affairs from Count <hi>Olivares</hi> the chief Miniſter of <hi>Spain,</hi> who finding that the Legat could not bring his buſineſs to that paſſe as was expected, reſolved to uſe his utmoſt to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate things in a peaceable manner, and accordingly made ſeveral overtures that way tending, to the <hi>Sieur de Fargis,</hi> Ambaſſador with his Catholique Majeſty, who was not wanting to give ſpeedy notice of it hither; and at the ſame time the <hi>Marquis de Mirabel,</hi> Ambaſſador for the Spaniard certified to the Marſhal <hi>de Schomberg</hi> that his Maſter deſired a Peace. Whereupon orders were ſent to the <hi>Sieur de Fargis,</hi> that he ſhould anſwer to ſuch overtures as had been made, that his Maſter would not be unwilling to embrace it, if it might be made upon Honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and ſafe conditions; and he was alſo acquainted with the Kings deſiers in that particular which were reduced under three principall heads. Firſt, that the Span<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jards ſhould renounce all pretenſes to the Paſſages in the <hi>Valtoline,</hi> next that the Soverainty of the <hi>Valtoline</hi> ſhould be preſerved to the <hi>Griſons,</hi> and laſt related to the ſafety of the Catholique Religion, he acquitted himſelf of their directions very diligently, but with ſo much heat, that after ſeveral meetings and conferences had with the Count <hi>d'Olivarez,</hi> they at laſt ſet down their ſeveral propoſals in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, which being agreed upon, they were ſigned by them, though the <hi>Sieur de Fargis,</hi> had no power ſo to do. The <hi>Sieur de Fargis</hi> conceiving he had diſpatched a great affair, preſently ſent away the Treaty to the King, who was not a little ſurpriſed, as alſo his Miniſters, to find a Treaty of peace concluded by his Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor, who had no Authority for it, nor had ever ſent any word of advice about it. His Majeſty ſeemed by this precedure to be obliged to recall him, and at his return to treat him according to his deſerts: but his prudence guiding him in it, he would not preſently conclude ſo to do, but propoſed the buſineſs to be debated by his Miniſters. Many were of opinion abſolutely, to reject this pretended Treaty, not onely becauſe the Form of it was ill, but becauſe it was likewiſe an offence to the Kings Allyes, it being concluded without them; and withall, the haſte and eagerneſs which appeared in the Spaniards was a manifeſt ſign of their weakneſs, which might not be paſſed by without taking ſome advantage of it.</p>
                  <p>But the Cardinal taking hold of the diſcourſe, told his Majeſty, that prudence did not ſo much tye men up to conſider the Forms as the ſubſtances of things, and withall told him that he thought it more proper to ſtand to the conditions, of the Treatie, then to diſpute the manner of the Treatie; and how the <hi>Sieur de Fargis</hi> had concluded it; He confeſſed that thoſe Termes which his Majeſty had deſired, were not expreſſed with all the circumſtances and limitations, as was to be wiſhed, and yet he repreſented to him, that it was no ſmall matter to have obtained of the Spaniards, the chief points which were demanded; for they renounced the paſſages in the <hi>Valtoline;</hi> they were contented the Soverainty ſhould remaine in the <hi>Griſons,</hi> and in concluſion he freely declared, That to his apprehenſion it were not proper raſhly to reject that Treaty, for that the Spaniſh Ambaſſador had lately told the Marſhal <hi>de Schomberg,</hi> that in caſe there were any thing to be altered in point of form, or if any of the Articles were too harſh, it would be more proper to review and amend them, then to neglect the reuniting of the two Crowns. Then he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed his Majeſty, how that his taking up Arms was for the eſtabliſhing the <hi>Griſons</hi> in their Soveraignty and to preſerve the paſſages of the <hi>Valtoline</hi> for France, in excluding the Spaniards quite from them, and that his Majeſty obtayning both one and t'other he might both with advantage and reputation, hearken to the peace. That true it was his Allyes might complain of it, but without any ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, if once thoſe ends were obtained, for which the league was made, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all the ſmall ſucceſſe of the Army in <hi>Italy</hi> made it apparent, there was little to be got by it. In ſhort, he beſeeched his Majeſty to weigh one thing of great conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:56802:61"/>which was that <hi>Rochel</hi> not being yet reduced under his obedience, it would be an eaſie matter for the Spaniards to ſtir up the Hugonots to revolt, who finding themſelves countenanced and ſupported by ſeveral Princes of the Court, would divert one part of his Forces, and would impede his ſending of ſo many Forces as would be needfull on t'other ſide the Hils, ſo that inſtead of expecting a good Iſſue of the wars in <hi>Italy,</hi> there was great fear of many dangers in it. The Prudence of this incomparable Miniſter, urged ſo many ſtrong reaſons, that they were impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to be anſwered, ſo that his Majeſty reſolved to lay hold on thoſe advantages in the Treaty and to amend what ſhould be thought fit in it; To which purpoſe Orders were diſpatched to the <hi>Sieur de Fargis,</hi> with command to induce the Count <hi>d'Olivarez</hi> to agree to them, and in caſe he ſhould make and difficulty of it, that he himſelf ſhould preſently take his leave and return home, to give an accompt of his buſineſs.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Sieur de Fargis</hi> having received them, on the fifteenth of <hi>February,</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed himſelf with all dilligence to repair the fault which he had committed, and alſo in his letters to his Majeſty teſtified a great deal of ſorrow for it, which how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever did not with hold him from running into a ſecond, for he concluded upon and ſigned another Treaty with the Count <hi>d'Olivarez,</hi> ſomewhat better indeed then the former, but not ſtrictly conformable to his Orders and inſtructions, ſo that ſending them to his Majeſty, they would not be accepted of unleſſe once more amended: and alſo his Majeſty that he might take away all ſuſpition from the <hi>Marquis de Mirabel,</hi> that he did approve of this manner of proceeding in his Ambaſſador he wiſhed in a publique audience, that <hi>Fargis</hi> had been but as diſcreet as he was; that the firſt time, he did a thing of his one brayn, without any autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and that in the ſecond he had not followed his Orders and Inſtructions, for which he ſhould exemplarily be puniſhed. But that in the mean time both him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf &amp; the King of <hi>Spain</hi> did reape ſome benefit by his Folly, in that they might both diſcover one anothers minds to be without gall, and to be well enclined to peace, of which that he might give an evident teſtimony, he would ſend a Treaty to his Ambaſſador with the leaſt alteration that could be, and ſuch a one as the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> would not make any ſcruple to accept of.</p>
                  <p>The Treaty was drawn up, and before it was diſpatched the King gave one part of it to the Prince of <hi>Piedmont,</hi> and to the <hi>Venetian</hi> Ambaſſador who both having ſeveral particular deſigns quite different from that of the league, neither of them did approve of it, either in ſubſtance or form; and the Prince himſelf took his leave of the King to return into <hi>Piedmont.</hi> The <hi>Marquis de Mirable,</hi> was informed of their reſentments, who ſeeming to ſuſpect an abſolute breach, preſſed very earneſtly for a quick diſpatching of the Treaty away towards <hi>Spain,</hi> in ſuch manner and form as his Majeſty deſired it ſhould be amended, and gave great hopes that all things would be concluded in a happy end. So the Treaty was ſent away to the <hi>Sieur de Fargis</hi> who received it at <hi>Barcelona,</hi> and as his own Intereſts as well as thoſe of <hi>France</hi> did excite him to it, ſo he played his part ſo dexterouſly with the Count <hi>d'Olivarez,</hi> that it was ſoon after ſigned and concluded between them, and antidated from the fifth of <hi>March</hi> at <hi>Mouſon,</hi> to evade any complaints of Cardinal <hi>Barbarini,</hi> who had bin at <hi>Barcelona,</hi> before the Treaty was ſigned and had no hand in it, for fear onely of ſome great delayes, which he might have raiſed, becauſe he had no other anſwer made him to thoſe overtures of his for peace, but onely complements and thanks, &amp; aſſurances that the peace was concluded. The chief Articles were, That the Affairs of the <hi>Griſons</hi> and the <hi>Valtoline</hi> ſhould be reſtored into the ſame ſtate, they were before the war, in the year one thouſand ſix hundred and ſeventeen, preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving by this means the Soverainty to the <hi>Griſons,</hi> and the abſolute diſpoſing power of the Paſſages to <hi>France,</hi> in whoſe actual poſſeſſion they then were; that there never ſhould any exerciſe of Religion be eſtabliſhed in the <hi>Valtoline,</hi> but only the Roman Catholique and Apoſtolique, that the <hi>Valtolines</hi> might elect their own Governors and Magiſtrates, all Catholiques either of the <hi>Griſons</hi> or the <hi>Valtolines.</hi> That ſuch elections ſhould be confirmed by the <hi>Griſons,</hi> who ſhould not however
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:56802:62"/>have any power to refuſe the Ratification of them: That all the Forts in the <hi>Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toline</hi> ſhould be reſtored into the Popes hands, to be forth with raſed and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>molliſhed that the two Kings ſhould proceed with all ſincerity, to ſettle peace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween ſuch of their Allyes as had ingaged in the wars with them, and that neither of them ſhould openly or privately give any abbetting or aſſiſtance, to the continuing of the war between them, without having firſt uſed all fair means and wayes, for the ſetling of a peaceable and friendly agreement. Thus were all the grounds of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between them ended and concluded, to the great Happineſs of Chriſtendom, though by away in it ſelf extravagant enough, and contrarie to all uſual Forms.</p>

What ſence is there not to accept of that which is aymed at when occaſion doeth preſent, but to leave it off to the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of time and Fortune, and all to finiſh it, with certain Ceremonies, which at laſt caſt do not at all advantage the thing doing? The end ſay the Philoſophers, hath this propertie, That it terminateth all motion; and ſo a ſtone reſteth when once arrived at the center of the Earth, the end which the Creator of Nature hath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed unto it.</p>
                  <p>So the Artificer, when once he hath perfected his workmanſhip, forbeareth any further labour about it; and it is moſt certain that all cauſes whether natural or ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificial, do prefer reſt before motion, if it were not neceſſary to admit of Actions for the attaining that end whereunto it tendeth.</p>
                  <p>Who knoweth not that Publique peace is the end of a wiſe Prince, and the very thing too for which he doth attempt any war, and that he would never deſign war but only for the obtayning of a quiet ſure reſt? The ſick perſon would never have any recourſe to the Phiſitian, if he had no need of putting his diſtempered body into a good order.</p>
                  <p>And what Reaſon could there be for continuation of the war, when there is an over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture offered for accepting of an honorable and advantageous peace? to do ſo were point blanck againſt the preſcribed rule of Juſtice, of which both art &amp; nature giveth us examples. Admit there be ſome formalities wanting in the Treaty, they ought to be conſidered in the order of negotiation, in the ſame manner, as the motions of nature; and as no one maketh any eſteem of motion when as the pretended end is once obtained: So the wiſeſt Polititians doe lay by the conſiderations of all for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malities, when once they are arrived at that pitch which they propoſe to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>

His Inſtruction conſiſted of three particualrs, The firſt to induce his Highneſs to aſſent unto the Treaty of <hi>Mouſon,</hi> and to qualifie his reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for that it had been done without him. The ſecond was to diſpoſe him to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards a ceſſation of Arms, with thoſe of <hi>Genoa,</hi> and to refer the buſineſs of their differences to arbitration, and laſtly to treat with him, concerning the intereſts of his houſe, and withal to proffer him his Majeſties aſſiſtance to raiſe him, to the greateſt point of glory, that he could aime at. Upon the firſt of theſe three points, the <hi>Sieur de Bullion</hi> had orders to give his Highneſs to underſtand, that the manner of <hi>Sieur de Fargis</hi> his proceeding in it, had deprived his Majeſty of all poſſible means to communicate it to his Highneſs, and that his Majeſty having had adviſe upon it, was counſelled to lay hold on peace, in regard of the diſpoſition of Affairs both within and without his Kingdome, conſidering the ſmall progreſſe the Arms of the League had made after two years time in <hi>Italy,</hi> and laſtly for that thoſe very things were obtain'd in the Peace, for which the League had been contrived, all which things were much more conſiderable then any Formalities and Punctilio's of honour. Upon the ſecond point the <hi>Sieur de Bullion</hi> had expreſſe charge to tell his Highneſs, that his Majeſty had ſo much the more willingly conſented to the Treaty of Peace, that he might be capable of ending his differences with the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth of <hi>Genoa</hi> by arbitration, in reſpect his Arms had ſo little contributed to advance his intereſts as yet, and that if his Highneſs would be pleaſed to make known his pretentions.

Upon the third point, which had no relation to any thing of the League, and yet was no inconſiderable thing neither, for that it was deſigned only to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay and take off from the Dukes anger and paſſion, that his Majeſty well knowing the courage and magnanimity of this Prince, and that it was his high mind which made him eſteem glory above all things, as alſo that eminent Titles of honour have a great influence on the Souls of thoſe who are touched with greatneſs, and that it
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:56802:63"/>doth bring them to that point which is pretended, commanded the <hi>Sieur de Bullion</hi> to humour this inclinations, and to let him know that his Majeſty had by the <hi>Sieur de Bethune</hi> propoſed to the Pope, to cauſe him be Crowned King of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> as wel in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the pretenſions which the houſe of <hi>Savoy</hi> hath upon that Kingdom, as alſo in regard of his particular valour, which was riſen to ſo high an admiration and credit in the whole World, that this Title could not with Juſtice be denied him, and that there was not any King in Chriſtendom, which would not be wel ſatisfied with the admiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a Prince of his Birth and recommendation, into that degree and quality.</p>

                  <p>THE <hi>Sieur de Bulloin</hi> made uſe of his Reaſon with ſo much Judgement and Prudence, that he obtained all he could deſire: The Ceſſation of Arms was conſented to; and accordingly, proclaimed in <hi>Milan, Genoa,</hi> and <hi>Piedmont.</hi> The referring of the buſineſſe to Arbitration was well approved of, and his Highneſſe delivered a breviate of his pretenſions to the Crown of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> to the <hi>Sieur at Bullion,</hi> who aſſured he would recommend that buſineſſe particularly to his Majeſty; and told him, that moſt aſſuredly his Majeſty would be very careful of it.

                     </gap> to the Common-wealth of <hi>Venice,</hi> That they had great reaſon to be well ſatisfied with the Peace, ſeeing it freed them from a chargeable War, ſubject to many accidents, and in which well they might loſe much, but gain little. And becauſe the Venetian Embaſſador declared that he did imagine the aſſurance of the Treaty to conſiſt in the keeping up of thoſe Forts in the <hi>Valtoline;</hi> the ſaid <hi>Sieur de Chaſteauneuf</hi> had Order to let them know, that ſuch a pretenſion as that was, would moſt aſſuredly have broken off the Treaty of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation, and that all that was to be wiſhed, was ſometimes impoſſible to be effected: Beſides that, the keeping up of the Fort; would be a great charge, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in relation to the neceſſary expences, for the giving of a full ſatisfaction, or elſe for the maintaining of a ſtrong Gariſon, and who at laſt caſt too, might not peradventure be able to keep out the Spaniard, if at any time hee ſhould have a mind to enter upon them with an Army. He was alſo charged to let them perceive that the natural inclination of the <hi>Valtolines,</hi> was not to indure any Rule or Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and that they would never have indured any long time together, that thoſe Forts ſhould remain in the power of a ſtranger, and that the Spaniards know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their natures to be ſuch, would alwaies be inciting and aſſiſting them under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand to retake them; ſo that the keeping up of the Forts, would inſtead of ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Treaty, onely become an abſolute ground of troubles to the Common-wealth; as they who are neareſt ſeated to the <hi>Valtoline,</hi> who are in perpetual fears and jealouſies, and forced ſtill to be upon their Guard againſt the Spaniards at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts, which would put them to vaſt charges, and force them too at laſt to yeeld to reaſon. And he was commanded by his Majeſty, that he might humour the Commonwealth in its Intereſts, to tell them, that the King would willingly grant them the Paſſages of the <hi>Valtoline</hi> and <hi>Griſons</hi> for ten years, he knowing how paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onately they deſired it; and moreover, that his Majeſty would in caſe they ſhould requeſt it, enter into a defenſive League with them.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Sieur de Chaſteauneuf</hi> proſecuted theſe Inſtructions ſo luckily, that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth was ſenſible of the honour the King had done them, in ſending to them an extraordinary Embaſſadour upon their Affairs; and left it to his Majeſty to conſider, whether all thoſe advantages which were to be wiſhed for, were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:56802:63"/>in the Treaty, and that for their particulars, they thought themſelves much obliged for his proffer of a defenſive League, aſſuring the ſaid <hi>Sieur de Chaſteau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neuf,</hi> that they ſhould be ever ready to continue thoſe teſtimonies of affection and obſervance, which they had alwaies had towards the Crown of <hi>France,</hi> which was as much as could be deſired from them. Then the <hi>Sieur de Chaſteauneuf</hi> went to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the <hi>Griſons</hi> and the <hi>Valtoline</hi> in proſecution of his Embaſſiy: The Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which he received from his Majeſty concerning thoſe parts, was to joyn him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with the Marqueſſe <hi>de Coeuvres</hi> and to ſwear thoſe people to a ſolemn obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Treaty. The <hi>Valtolines</hi> made not any difficulty at all at it, but accepted of the Treaty, as alſo to pay every year unto the <hi>Griſons,</hi> five and twenty thouſand Crowns, which had been impoſed on them: But as for the <hi>Griſons,</hi> there were many meetings and Aſſemblies held amongſt them, without any reſolution; but onely in general terms they thanked his Majeſty, for his aſſiſtance, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged themſelves infinitely obliged to him. But as to the Treaty, they deſired they might ſend their Deputies towards his Majeſty to repreſent to him the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which did ariſe in their acceptation of the ſaid agreement, by reaſon of the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration of Juſtice, ſeeing the Magiſtracy and Authority, was given into the hands of the <hi>Valtolines.</hi> They accordingly ſent their Deputies to make their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, but after they were once fully informed of the Juſtice of thoſe reaſons which invited them to accept of the Treaty, ſeeing otherwiſe it would be impoſſible to preſerve the Soveraignty of the <hi>Valtoline</hi> to them, or to defend themſelves from a perpetual War with the <hi>Valtolines,</hi> who being under-p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="3 letters">

So the <hi>Sieur de Chasteauneuf</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued on his journey towards <hi>Switzerland,</hi> for the ſatisfying of his Majeſties pleaſure, who had commanded him to induce the Cantons both Catholick and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant to accept of the Treaty, ſeeing they had not a little contributed to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of the <hi>Valtoline,</hi> by thoſe Troops which they had ſent thither, and that it were not amiſſe to ingage them in the execution of thoſe Articles of Peace, for that they might be very much aſſiſting towards the preſerving of the <hi>Valtoline</hi> in that condition as had now been reſolved on. To the Catholiques he repreſented, that they had great reaſon to be ſatisfied with it, ſeeing the Catholique Religion was eſtabliſhed ſo firmly in the <hi>Valtoline;</hi> and to the Proteſtants he alledged, that conſidering the Soveraignty was maintained to the <hi>Griſons,</hi> they had reaſon to reſt contented; accordingly, the Catholicks reſolved to ſubſcribe to it and to perſwade the <hi>Griſons</hi> to do the like. And the Proteſtants after ſome difficulties at firſt, being ſhortly after aſſembled at <hi>Aran,</hi> reſolved likewiſe to imbrace it, excepting as to what concern'd Religion, and delivered their Declaration at the ſame time to the <hi>Sieur de Chaſteauneuf.</hi> And thus the Treaty being accepted of all hands, that were any wayes concerned in it, there remained onely the putting it in execution.</p>

                  <head>The Reaſons which oblige great Princes to ſhew an extrardinary honour to the Pope.</head>
                  <p>THere are divers Reaſons which invite great Princes to pay an extraordinary reſpect so the Pope. They are bound to it by duty, ſeeing as St. <hi>Bernard</hi> ſaith, he is the high Prieſt, the Soveraign Biſhop, the Prince of Biſhops, Heir to the Apoſtles, that he is like <hi>Abel</hi> in his Priority, <hi>Noah</hi> in his Government, <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> in his Patriarch-ſhip, <hi>Melchiſedech</hi> in his Order, <hi>Aaron</hi> in his dignity, <hi>Samuel</hi> in the excellency of his Judgement, <hi>St. Peter</hi> in the Power which he received from the Son of God, ſeeing he is the cheef of Chriſtians, the Shepheard of the people, the Rod of the Mighty, the Hammer of Tyrants, the Father of Kings, the Light of the World, and the Lievtenant of God upon Earth: And who ſeeth not that all theſe eminent qualities, do make him amongſt other Potentates here below, the ſame that the Sun is in compariſon of the reſt of the Stars? And then looking on his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and beholding the Object whom he doth repreſent, which is no other than
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:56802:65"/>God himſelf, ought not every one be perſwaded to treat him, withall imaginable reſpects for the love of God the Almighty Lord, who governing States by the hand of Providence, doth moſt commonly bleſſe them in that proportion, as Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces reſpect thoſe for his ſake who belong unto him. To ſpeak truth, this honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them is a Loadſtone, which draweth down all kind of bleſſings from Heaven, which conduce to the Happineſs of Kingdomes: And if neither of the two conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations ſhould be potent enough, over the minds of Kings, to perſwade them to bear a great reverence to the Pope; yet in my opinion they are bound to it by a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Politick and conſiderable reaſon, which is to preſerve themſelves in Peace. For that it hath been alwaies judged neceſſary that amongſt Princes there ſhould be an Impartial chief, and a general father of Jeſus Chriſts family, who might accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate their differences, and might by his Counſels moderate, the violence of thoſe, who make unjuſt attempts, and who might unite their Arms and Powers to defend the from the violences of its enemies.</p>
                  <p>If it ſhould ſo happen that the Pope ſhould become contemptible by the little reſpect which is rendred to him, what credit could he have, to conclude or effect ſuch things amongſt them? what eſteem could he have to end their differences. They might force him to contain himſelf within the limits of his ſpiritual juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, without medling in temporal affairs, but in the <hi>interim,</hi> the fire of war would often break out amongſt them, with ſuch fury that both themſelves &amp; eſtates would be conſumed in the Flames of it: Whereas did they but receive his Counſels with reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pective honour, and admit of his perſwaſions with eſteem, his dignity would then become venerable amongſt them all, and he might with eaſe accommodate their diviſions, by his allotting to each one what belongeth juſtly unto him, he might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore peace to the Nations, and ſtop the courſe of all violent proceedings.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>AS Peace is the moſt ſure Foundation of the happineſſe of Kingdomes, ſo the Cardinal was not ſatisfied to have ſetled it abroad, but indeavoured the procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring it for thoſe of <hi>Rochel,</hi> and to eſtabliſh it in <hi>France,</hi> both for the greateſt good of the people, and the higheſt glory of his Majeſty that could be aimed at. Hee quickly ſet on work divers perſons of the Town, whom he had gained by opening their eyes, and who were potent enough, with ſeveral others, to perſwade them to follow the example of the reſt of their Party. So that the Deputies who had been ſent by the Aſſemblies of the Hugonots, comming to Court to preſent to his Majeſty the Ratification of the Articles of Peace, which it had pleaſed his Majeſty to accord to them the year laſt paſt, were accompanied with thoſe of <hi>Rochel,</hi> who came in their behalf to offer their ſubmiſſions, and to beſeech him that they might obtain the ſame grace and favour which had been granted to the reſt of that party. It is true, they did not ſo much repent for their Rebellion, as they were ſorry for thoſe inconveniences, which the Kings Army had put upon them, then command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Marſhal <hi>de Themines,</hi> who ſucceeded the Marſhal <hi>de Pleſſis,</hi> and who preſſed ſo cloſe upon them, that they could not peep out, but in danger of being taken: For that they no longer had the liberty of injoying their Goods, and that all their Traffique was ſpoiled. Affliction doth at laſt open the eyes of thoſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels, whom inſolency and ambition had but lately cloſed up, of which they gave aſſured proof, by thoſe earneſt intreaties which they made to his Majeſty, to forget the Rebellion of which they had been guilty. The ſame reaſons which invited his Majeſty to ſhew his Clemency to the reſt of that party, did alſo perſwade him to do the like to them of <hi>Rochel;</hi> as alſo the Cardinal hinted one more to him, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what powerfuller then the reſt. There had then been newly diſcovered a Combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natiyn between divers Princes and Lord, of the Court as ſhall be anon declared, and amongſt others, one of their deſigns, was to ingage <hi>Menſieur</hi> with the Hugonots Party; ſo that if Peace had not been granted to <hi>Rochel</hi> as well as to the other Towns and Cities, it were the ready way to let open a door for War, and to give
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:56802:65"/>thoſe Rebels the more means to execute their deſigns by a high hand; for it were an eaſie matter by the means of this one City, to raiſe all the party. And laſt of all, this great Miniſter laid down before his Majeſty, That the Engliſh (being as they were picking a quarrel with us, to which they were inclined) would upon a word ſpeaking find <hi>Rochel</hi> ready to let them into <hi>France.</hi> Theſe reaſons of State were of great weight, and fit to be conſidered, of which his Majeſty being ſenſible, he did at laſt grant the City of <hi>Rochel</hi> the favour which was deſired, and the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal was not a little diligent to watch that this Peace were not concluded upon ſuch ſhamefull Articles, and full of baſeneſſe, as formerly they had been. The King conſented that the Town ſhould be delivered into the hands of the Corporation, on condition they kept no Ships of War; that they obſerved thoſe Orders for Traffique which were eſtabliſhed in the reſt of the Kingdome: That they ſhould reſtore to the Eccleſiaſtiques all the Goods which had been taken from them: That they ſhould ſuffer the Catholicks to live freely and quietly in the exerciſe of the Roman Catholick and Apoſtolick Religion, and in the injoyment of thoſe Goods which appertained unto them: That his Majeſty ſhould leave what Gariſon he thought fit in Fort <hi>Lewis,</hi> and the Iſlands of <hi>Ree</hi> and <hi>Oleron,</hi> onely promiſing that out of his bounty and goodneſſe, he would ſettle ſuch a courſe in it, as thoſe of <hi>Rochel,</hi> might receive no trouble by it, either in their Commerce, or the injoyment of their goods. Theſe Articles were agreed on about the beginning of <hi>February,</hi> and the next day the general and particular Deputies ratified and confirmed them, thinking them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves happy, for having obtained this end from his Majeſties Bounty. By this years injoyment of Peace among the Hugonots, his Majeſty did with the more eaſe detect and break the deſigns of thoſe who were factiouſly bent, as alſo he aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted his Allies in <hi>Germany,</hi> he eaſed the people, and went on labouring in the means, for reſtoring of that happineſſe and glory, which had been ſo long wiſhed for in the Kingdome. I ſhall onely adde, that his Majeſty for the ſurer execution of the Treaty, ſent Commiſſaries to <hi>Rochel,</hi> who were received there with great honour: Thoſe of <hi>Rochel</hi> having ſent their Deputies to <hi>Surgeres,</hi> for the eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the exerciſe of Religion, and ſetling things into ſuch order, that there were very great hopes of a true Obedience and long Peace, had not that people been extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly much inured to Rebellion.</p>

                  <p>ALthough the Rebellions of ſubjects force a Prince to puniſh ſome for an example, yet prudence doth oblige him ſometimes to diſſemble it, and to give them peace, when as there is any fear of a greater miſchief to follow, by any new revolt, which joyning their flames with the former, might endanger the putting of the whole into combuſtion. It could not be any weakneſs of heart, or neceſſity (to which as an Antient ſaith, the Gods themſelves are obedient) will force him to it. It is no fault to fear, when as there is a juſt ground for it, but it is rather a great piece of prudence, and a vertue, without which there is no enjoyment of happy ſucceſs in war any long time together of this. <hi>Marcellus</hi> heretofore gave us a good example, when as <hi>Badius,</hi> that he might acknowledge the favour which <hi>Hanibal</hi> had done him, in ſaving his life, and giving him back his Ranſom, made the moſt part of the inhabitants of <hi>Nole</hi> revolt againſt the Romans in the Battle of <hi>Cannes.</hi> This Captain ſeeing the conjuncture of Affairs, did oblige him rather to allay then exaſperate, uſed his utmoſt power to regain <hi>Badius,</hi> by aſſuring him, that if he would but return to <hi>Rome,</hi> thoſe wounds which he had that day received, would bring him great rewards: <hi>Badius</hi> was much taken with the generouſneſſe of the Meſſage, and <hi>Marcellus</hi> the more to accompliſh his deſign, ſent him a very goodly Horſe, and five hundred drachma's of Silver, which did ſo oblige him, that he was ever after very loyal and faithfull to him, ſo that from that time forward he would never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict any puniſhment upon thoſe who were revolted. It was more by Prudence then by Force that the Romans became Maſters of the Univerſe. A diſcreet Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:56802:66"/>ought much rather to induce his Maſter to accommodation on ſuch occaſions, then to hazard the State in any eminent danger, by too much ſtiffeneſſe in reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for the puniſhing of thoſe who are revolted, when they are upon the point of having a ſtrong aſſiſtance, by which means they may hazard the ſucceſſe of the War.</p>

                  <p>JT was no ſmall happineſſe for <hi>France</hi> to be thus at Peace abroad, and with the Hugonots at home, but the Cardinal could not imagine it ſufficient, if not ſetled amongſt the Nobility, who were every day cutting one anothers Throats in Duels. It was impoſſible to perſwade them by any reaſons, that it was one of the greateſt parts of glory, for a wiſe man and a Chriſtian, to overcome his own emotions of anger, and to forgive his enemies. So this great Miniſter inſinuated into his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, who was already zealouſly deſirous of Juſtice: That nothing was ſo contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the Law of God, and the welfare of his own State, as Duels, in which there every day periſhed many of the Nobility, and which hath been alwaies known for one of the greateſt Incendiaries of <hi>France.</hi> It was no hard matter, to perſwade him to ſtop the further courſe of it, by the terrours of thoſe puniſhments included <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

And beſides, that a third part of their Goods ſhould be confiſcated: That the perſon who carrieth a Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge ſhould under the Penalties aboveſaid be baniſhed three whole years: That all ſuch as ſhould aſſault or fight with one another<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> upon any occaſion, ſhould be proce<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Theſe were the chief puniſhments included in the Edict, and upon the publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it, his Majeſty took a ſolemn oath, not to ſhe any favour to thoſe who ſhould break it, and commanded his officers, that if it ſhould happen that his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, might by importunity be drawn to grant any pardons for it, they ſhould take no notice of it, and enjoyned the Marſchals of <hi>France</hi> to have a great care in en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding any difference which might ariſe between the nobility, giving them authority, that in caſe any ſhould refuſe to give that ſatisfaction, which ſhould by them be injoyned, they ſhould preſently beſides thoſe puniſhments of impriſonment, and ſuch others as might be inflicted on them, be forth with degraded of their nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It was however much to be doubted, leſt thoſe, who ſhould be challenged and did n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>PRinces may not permit Duels without partaking in the Crimes of them; for who ſo hath the Authority in his hands, and maketh not uſe of it, to puniſh thoſe offences which are committed againſt the Laws, is no leſſe guilty, then they who are the abſolute Authors of ſuch miſdemeanors. The people do not only violate the Law in the perſons of their Kings; but the Kings themſelves in not puniſhing the offenders, are guilty of the ſame crime.</p>
                  <p>How unjuſt is it to leave Duels unpuniſhed, ſeeing they are condemned by the Judgment of God, when he ſaid, his Blood ſhall be ſpilt, that ſpilleth the Blood of his Neighbour. And under the new Law who ſo ſhall take the Sword in hand ſhall periſh by the Sword. I may ſafely ſay, there is not any Crime ſo enormous as this, for the man who commiteth it, taketh that Authority which God hath reſerved to himſelf, according to that ſaying of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Romans,</hi> Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance is mine, and I will repay it. And it is not only an attempt upon Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative, but alſo one of the greateſt miſeries that a Common-wealth can be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted with: For as a great loſſe of Blood, extinguiſheth the vigor of our bodies, maketh our faces become pale, and rendreth nature weak and languiſhing: So likewiſe is it with Duels, which draw out the moſt couragious Blood of the nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, in which conſiſteth the Chief ſtrength of the State, which mightily impair the force of it, exſtinguiſhing the lively colours of its beauty, and bringing it into a lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing condition: And if the State be injured in it, thoſe particular perſons who periſh in ſuch combats are much more expoſed to many unhappineſſes; for with, the life of their bodies, they likewiſe loſe that of their Souls, by the loſſe of which the utmoſt they can hope for is to become objects of Gods Juſt vengeance, who is ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome wanting to puniſh even thoſe who eſcape with the victorie, with ſome no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table chaſtiſement, unleſſe they pacifie him by a true repentance: For can it be otherwiſe then very diſpleaſing to him to behold his workmanſhip ſo deſtroyed, which coſt him ſo much, and to ſee ſuch Souls ruined by the enemy, which have heretofore invited him to ſhew ſuch effects of his power, and ſuch miracles of his love, and all for their ſakes?</p>
                  <p>The cauſe of this misfortune is no other then a falſe and damnable tenent, which finds wayes to perſwade men, that it is glorious to be revenged, and that to ſuffer an injurie unpuniſhed by their Swords, is a great loſſe to their Honour. But can there be any reaſon to think an Action honourable, which is ſo contrary to God's Laws? It cannot be denied but that the nobility do draw there Chief glory from their courages, but there is a great difference between this vertue of generoſity and the Paſſion of Revenge. This ſame vertue is no fury, and tranſportation of the mind, to things againſt both humane and divine Laws: But it is a vigorous reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution; commendable in a generous Soul which maketh him deſpiſe dangers, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally when his Prince commandeth him to fight againſt the enemies of the State. Valour hath it's limitation as all other vertues, and who ſo goeth beyond thoſe bounds, falleth into the extremity of vice, whence it hapened that <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> ſaid, according as <hi>Plutarch</hi> reporteth it, That valour ought not to be regarded, if not accompanied with Juſtice. Now that which is ſhewed upon private authority, is it not quite contrarie to it? Reaſon obligeth a man to overcome himſelf at private and particular quarrels, juſt as he would his enemies. In Common-wealths well governed Revenge is an Act ſavouring of a Brute. <hi>Socrates</hi> once anſwered a certain man who beat him, If I were an Aſſe I ſhould run upon thee too, but being a man I muſt endure it with patience. Is there any reaſon or ſenſe to fix honour upon an Action prohibited by God, and forbidden by nature? Honour would be but ill grounded, if it had any dependance, upon an unruly paſſion; it cannot be linked to any thing but vertue, and none but they who are overſwayed by paſſion do pretend to attain it, but by vertuous wayes.</p>

                  <p>WHilſt his Majeſty was uſing theſe juſt and prudent means, for the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhing of Peace in the State, There did ariſe very great diſputes in the Univerſity of <hi>Paris,</hi> eſpecially between the Doctors of Divinity; and all about a certain book compoſed by a <hi>Ieſuit,</hi> one <hi>Sanctarellus</hi> by name, which treated of the power Popes had over Kings, which book had been approved by their Chief Preſident, by his Holinefs Vicegerent, and by the Maſter of the Holy Palace. His Doctrine was very ſtrange, teaching that Popes had a Power of direction, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther correction over Princes, that they might not onely excommunicate them, but deprive them of their Kingdomes too, and abſolve their Subjects from their Oaths of Allegiance, whether it were for Hereſie, Apoſtacy, or any other great publick Crime, whether it were for the inſufficiency of their perſons, or for their not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending the Church; and that his Holineſſe might at laſt give their States to ſuch as he ſhould think fit. They who were clear ſighted, attributed this work to the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards Ambition, which uſeth all devices to ſtir up commotion amongſt their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, and fiſh their own ends out of the troubled Waters, and who did at that time chiefly aim to draw the hatred of all Chriſtendome upon the King, by reaſon of the ſuccours which he had given to the Griſons and Hollanders, and of ſome aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance which the Princes of <hi>Germany,</hi> who were oppreſſed by them, did hope for from his Majeſty.

But that we may not be longer ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the conſideration of the promoters of ſo ſtrange an opinion.

                  <p>IT is very often no leſſe important to prevent the offending of the Regal Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, by the publiſhing of any pernicious Doctrine, then to oppoſe any vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lences which are offered to it by Arms. In my opinion he ſpoke very learnedly, who likened this authority to the apple of the eye, which may not be touched though never ſo little, but the whole man is ſuddenly troubled and hurt by it; for to ſay truth, it can hardly be expreſſed unto how many inconveniences a State is expoſed, when once the authority is entrenched upon, or ſhaken, though it be but a very little. But would not that Magiſtrate be very much to blame, who ſhould ſuffer, that the authority of our Kings ſhould be brought under any other power, which might deſpoil them of it? Were it not the only ready way to open a gate to the revolts of Grandees, who would find means enough to embroyle the State as often as they pleaſed, if the people might but once be perſwaded that the King were guilty of any great ſin, uncapable of ruling, ſuſpected of hereſy, or a favourer of heretiques? were it not the ready way to furniſh the ambition of ſtrangers with a pretext for entring upon and invading the Nation, when and as often as they
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:56802:67"/>would, or had power ſo to do? Beſides, what appearance of any reaſon were there to tollerate ſo dangerous at enent, and which all the Fathers of antiquity have condemned as erroneous, &amp; which too was but now late riſen up again, in theſe laſt ages, and in the time of <hi>Gregory</hi> the ſeventh, who firſt attempted to make it vallid? The King never ceaſeth to be King, until he be depoſed by him, who firſt conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted him to be King, or unleſſe he falls under thoſe conditions which his firſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutor hath declared ſhould be the means he would uſe to throw him down from his authority; Our Kings are only appointed by the hand of God: He hath made uſe of their courages to ſet the Crown upon their heads, and God hath not appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that either Apoſtaſie, Hereſie, or any other Crime ſhould be the condition, which ſhould ſhake them out of their Authority, for that both good and bad do equally raign, as we have heretofore ſaid, and by conſequence they cannot be depoſed but by God himſelf; nor can they be deprived of their Authority, for any crime whatever. Beſides, if they could be depoſed by Popes; it would neceſſarily follow that the Pope muſt be ſuperior to them in Temporal Power, for that ſuch depoſing muſt needs be the Act of a ſuperior Iurisdiction, now the Popes are ſo far from being above them in this particular, that rather on the contrarie the moſt ingenious and able writers of antiquity have confeſſed that they are inferior to them. Pope <hi>Gelaſius</hi> writ to the Emperor <hi>Anaſtaſius, Polagius</hi> the firſt to <hi>Childebert,</hi> one of our Kings, and St. <hi>Gregory</hi> to the Emperor <hi>Mauritius,</hi> and that in ſuch expreſs terms that their meaning cannot be queſtioned; The moſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate of them who uphold this error, cannot maintain againſt theſe reaſons, the power of diſpoſſing Kings, which they aſcribe to the Pope; they ſay indeed it is not an abſolute and direct power that they have, and that they do not ſo much excer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe it in deſpoyling them from commanding, as in diſpenſing their ſubjects from their oathes of allegiance which they had made to them; But how frivolous is this evaſion? For the Popes cannot diſpenſe with divine right, and the obedience from ſubjects to their Princes is commanded by divine right in an hundred expreſs places of Holy writ; But I ſhall paſſe farther on, and ſay that it is not in the power of a King to bring himſelf under ſuch a condition, as that their ſubjects can be diſcharged from their duties and oathes, by any means or way whatſoever, for they may not do any Act which is prejudicial to the Regal Authority, entruſted in their hands, but they are bound to leave it entire, not maymed to their ſucceſſors. Whence it hapned that <hi>Philip</hi> the <hi>Long,</hi> intending to make a Treaty with his ſubjects of Flanders, granted to them for their ſecurity of his obſerving the league, that they might riſe againſt him, and withdraw themſelves from his obedience, if he ſhould faile in that which did belong to him or his part, but he was hindred by thoſe of his counſel, who repreſented to him, that it was unlawful for him to make any ſuch condition.</p>

                  <p>THough Peace was very neceſſary for <hi>France,</hi> yet it was no leſſe needfull to prevent the riſing of the houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> in <hi>Germanie,</hi> which had uſurped the Lands of divers Princes there and oppreſſed their liberties, eſpecially ſince the Treaty of <hi>

<pb n="124" facs="tcp:56802:68"/>the Prudence of <hi>Monſieur</hi> the Cardinal, which is never deficient in the finding out expedients fit for the greatneſs his Maſter, and did give life and heat to that deſigne which the Princes of <hi>Germany,</hi> had heretofore reſolved on, of putting themſelves into the field, in defence of their liberty, and for the reſtabliſhing of thoſe, who had been forced out of their States.</p>
                  <p>The King, who hath a moſt admirable apprehenſion to Judg of thoſe counſels which are given, quickly conceived the goodneſs of this, and in order therunto he ſent about the end of the year, laſt part, the <hi>Sieur de la Picardiere,</hi> to the King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> the Princes of the Lower <hi>Saxany</hi> and the Auſeatique Citties; His in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions were to repreſent to the King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> and thoſe other Princes, that the King his Maſter did hear with much joy their reſolution to take up Arms, for the eſtabliſhing of the Prince Elector and his Brothers, and to repel thoſe menaces wherewith they were threatned, and the ancient friendſhip, which had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes kept their States in good Union, obliging his Majeſty to be ſollicitous, of their Intereſts, had induced him to ſend a proffer unto them, of what ever was within his power. They had beſeeched his Majeſty, not to engage himſelf in any league with <hi>Germany,</hi> without giving them notice of it, which he had not only order to aſſure them of, but alſo to promiſe them, the ſumme of a Million of livures in two years time, and French Troops beſides. He had moreover expreſs order to excite them to a quick diſpatch, becauſe experience hath made it evident on a thouſand occaſions, that the ſucceſſe of moſt enterpriſes doth uſually depend upon the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and dexterous excecuting of them, and that when as much time is taken in deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beration, the moſt favourable oportunities are loſt by it. But theſe reaſons were needleſs, for by that time that he came to them, he found them with their Arms in their hands, and the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> had already ſent ſome Forces by Sea, to joyne with thoſe of the other Princes, who began to threaten the Empeour, and forced him to ſend Count <hi>Tilly</hi> to advance towards them for the oppoſing of their deſigns: Yet he did not a little heighten their reſolution, ſetting them on, by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing to them what a glory it would be to them, to reſtabliſh their Allyes, and alſo by telling them with oportunities of advantage, they had againſt the Emperours Forces who were but weake, and much diſperſed, by reaſon of the warres in <hi>Italy</hi> and the <hi>Valtoline,</hi> whereas their Army was freſh, and numerous, and all their Forces met in a Body together.

An Enemy is ſometimes overcome by this way with more advantage, then if the whole force of a State had been imployed againſt him; at leaſt he will by this means be ſo buſied, that he will not have any time to think of attempting any thing on his neighbours, but rather how he may beſt defend himſelf, and yet one is not all this while forced to break with him, but preſerveth Peace in his own Country, one is at little or no charge, and the Souldiers will be ſpent who under go many great inconveniences in ſtrange Countries: The Embaſſadour who is to negotiate ſuch a Treaty, after he hath reſolved upon, and ſet down this truth for the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his good ſucceſſe.

                  <p>IT is as impoſſible long to keep <hi>France</hi> in quiet, as to prevent the agitation of the Sea by Winds. The humour of the French is full of Action, and they are no ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner clear of one broyl or War, but they are deſirous of beginning another. The Cardinal had uſed his utmoſt indeavour to ſettle the Kingdome in quiet, but divers young Princes and Lords of the Court, not able to reliſh the ſweetneſſe of ſuch a Calm, did ſtill ingage it in ſome new Commotions. Peace indeed did not ſo much grate upon their humours, as the cauſe which gave it, which was nothing elſe, but the Authority with which his Majeſty diſpatched the Affairs of the Realm, and the neceſſities which he layed upon them to live within the limits of their duties: Now as they had much adoe to ſubmit after they had many years lived in an intire licenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, they reſolved to employ all their indeavours to ſhake off the yoke. The moſt expert amongſt them, acquainted the reſt how the Cardinal was the man, who had perſwaded his Majeſty to take this power into his own hands; whence if fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed that they layed their heads together and contrived, how they might bring him into ſome diſgrace, or remove him by what means ſoever it were from the Stern. As their deſign was extravagant, ſo the wayes which they propoſed to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh it were extreamly difficult. They deſpaired of doing any good upon the Kings mind towards it, for that he was too clear ſighted, not to be mindfull of thoſe ſignal advantages which he had received from the ſage advices of this great Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, and too too indulgent of his States good, to deprive it of ſo prudent a ſupporter; ſo that they concluded there remained onely 2 ways, proper to attain their end. The firſt was to put all things into confuſion, &amp; then to force the Scepter out of the Kings hand, by which means they might bring things to that paſſe, that they might have none above them, but God to Pray too. The other was to form ſo powerful a Party a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Princes, that they might be able to give the Law to his Majeſty, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain him to baniſh the Cardinal, and to compel him to be ruled by their directions. This Cabal conſiſted of a great many perſons, which as it could not be done but with a multitude, ſo there wanted not ſome who ſpake very raſhly of it: There were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers reports ſpreadabroad of what they intended, which were publiſhed, though whiſperingly, with a great deal of inſolency, and at the ſame time it was known
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:56802:69"/>that a Favourite of <hi>Buckingham</hi>'s, ſaid openly in <hi>England,</hi> That there was ſo great a Faction contriving againſt the King, and carried on by <hi>Monſieurs</hi> Councellours, that all the Catholicks of the Queens houſe might be driven out without any dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and Heretiques placed in their room, though contrary to the Articles of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage. There were ſome two of the <hi>Bourbonnois</hi> ingaged in this Combination, who talked ſo openly and confidently, that notice being given of it to the King and his Miniſters; it was adjudged that they intended to carry things to extremity, and that it would not be much amiſs to give Commiſſion of Enquiry to the Vice-Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſchal of the <hi>Bourbonnois,</hi> to make enquiry of the truth, who gave a great light of the whole matter, by his informations. It was likewiſe diſcovered that Madam <hi>de Che<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>The Cardinal on the other ſide having been acquainted that <hi>Louvgry</hi> who was one of the cabal, being deeply in love with a Lady of quality; had diſcovered to her the ſumme of their deſign, and amongſt other things had aſſured her, that <hi>Chalais</hi> was one of the chief inſtruments in the enterpriſe, he reſolved to go paſſe away ſome time at <hi>Chailliot,</hi> in <hi>Chalais</hi> father in Laws houſe, that he might the better make uſe of his prudence to diſcover more particulars of the buſineſs. His deſign took effect, and as there are few things in his wiſh which the greatneſs of his prudence cannot accompliſh, it is ſaid that he found a device to learn ſeveral things from <hi>Chalais</hi> own mouth, and that he aſſured him both of his own aſſiſtance and his Majeſties favour in caſe he ſhould do that which was deſired of him in this buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of diſcovery. He likewiſe found out how the Colonel <hi>d' Ornano,</hi> was the Ringleader of the Plot, hurried into it by like for fear leſt if <hi>Mounſieur</hi> ſhould marry, his Princeſſe would aſſume to her ſelf, thoſe advantages which he then had over his Spirit; That their chief end was to unite all the Princes ſo cloſe together that they might enforce his Majeſty, not to remove any of them from the Court, and with all to permit them to live in the ſame licentiouſneſs that they had a long while formerly enjoyed; That to this effect, they endeavoured the brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the match between <hi>Monſieur</hi> and <hi>Madamoiſelle de M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

That this once effected, they intended the Count <hi>de Soiſſons</hi> ſhould marry <hi>Madamoiſelle de Montpenſier,</hi> that the Houſes of <hi>Guiſe</hi> and <hi>Bourbon</hi> might be united together, and in this manner, they would in a moment huddle up together almoſt all the leading potent perſons of Court. It was no ſmall advantage for the Affairs of the State to know that end this Cabal did drive at. The Cardinal was not defective, in acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging the ſervices which <hi>Chalais</hi> had done in that particular, and he might cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly have made very great advantages by it, had he not relapſed into former contrivances and deſigns.</p>

                  <p>IT is a very great Imprudence, to ingage in any Faction againſt the Prince of State, under hope of not being diſcovered.

All great ſecret is a great Burthen to the Bearer, and experience hath often ſhewed, that it is almoſt impoſſible, for a man to keep it any long time without disburthening his Breaſt of it: If perchance a man hath the power to bridle his tongue from diſcovering it, yet can he never forbear the diſcovery of it, by ſome Actions, which will ſpeak it to thoſe of underſtanding.

He had been ever ſince the beginning of the Spring at <hi>Fountainbleau,</hi> not ſo much for his recreation, as becauſe it was ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſier to dive into the bottome of thoſe Intreagues in ſuch little Towns then at <hi>Paris,</hi> the vaſtneſſe and confuſion of which is ſufficient to hide and ſhelter the greateſt wickedneſſes.

His importunities the true witneſſes of his exceſſive Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, made his Majeſty conclude that it was not ſafe any longer to defer the ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of his Perſon, and he thought it ſo much the more neceſſary, from the rule which he had learned in <hi>Tacitus,</hi> that for the hindering the progreſſe of a Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy againſt the State, it would be needfull to make ſure of the cheef; becauſe moſt commonly all the others are then left with as little motion, as the Members of the body, after the head is once cut off; beſides impriſoning of him, <hi>Monſieur</hi> too was in a manner ſecured; accordingly his Majeſty returning from hunting up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the fourth of <hi>May,</hi> gave command to ſome Companies of his Life-guard, to beſet the wayes between <hi>Fountain-bleau</hi> and <hi>Paris,</hi> to ſeize upon thoſe of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal, if they ſhould indeavour to ſave themſelves by flight; in fine, his Majeſty cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him to be Arreſted by the <hi>Sieur de Hallire</hi> Captain of his Guard, he was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned in the Caſtle, and from thence guarded to the <hi>Bois de Vincennes,</hi> where a few moneths after he died of a ſtoppage in the Bladder.</p>
                  <p>In the mean while his Majeſty, who never ſpeaks openly any one ſillable, which may be of conſequence in affairs, kept cloſe the reaſons which obliged him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain him, neither did he ſhew any coldneſſe in his carriage to his Complices, as well that he might prevent their running into extremities, and oblige them to quit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of wicked deſigns; as alſo that hee might have an opportunity to ſeize on <hi>Monſieur de Vendoſm,</hi> who was ſuſpected to be of that party, his Majeſty was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to ſignifie to the Queen his Mother, that he had impriſoned him by reaſon of-ſome broyls he had intended to raiſe between him and his Brother: <hi>Monſieur</hi> having notice of it, went preſently to wait upon the King, who aſſured him of the truth of it, and told him the ſame reaſon which he had ſent the Queen his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; to which <hi>Monſieur</hi> anſwered, that if he ſhould be convinced of the truth of it, he would be the firſt that ſhould proſecute Juſtice againſt him; but withall, that it were proper to conſider whether his enemies had not made this contrivance againſt him; but he could not contain himſelf upon this occaſion, as in divers others from teſtifying his diſpleaſure at it.</p>

                  <p>THE Soul of <hi>Monſieur</hi> the Cardinal did like the Palm undergo with Courage all thoſe burthens which were impoſed upon him, neither was he much moved at thoſe pernicious contrivances, though he knew his own ruine was the principal which they aimed at. However to remove all pretences which his enemies might raiſe to aſperſe him. That his fortune was built upon the loſſe of divers men of quality, if they ſhould be puniſhed according to their deſerts, and to take off any pretext for their making of Factions in the State, ſhould they but arrive to the end which they propoſed to themſelves, he reſolved to beſeech the King to give him leave to retire himſelf from the Court. He could not be reproached for this Act without injuſtice, ſeeing the diſcontent of all thoſe Factious perſons was onely grounded upon the Power, Authority, and Glory, which he had acquired for his Maſter, and the good Order and Government which he had eſtabliſhed in the State. Great and Noble Souls, cannot endure that Envy her ſelf ſhould have the leaſt occaſion to detract from their Glory; and accordingly, he teſtified to the whole Nation, that he did not at all conſider his own Intereſts. Now that hee might the eaſilier obtain his requeſt of with-drawing himſelf, and that he might the better diſpoſe his Majeſty to grant it, he entreated the King being then at <hi>Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainbleau,</hi> that he would give him leave to paſſe away ſome few days at <hi>Limours,</hi> by reaſon of ſome indiſpoſition, which he found growing upon him, which the King gave way to, and being there, he was viſited by <hi>Monſieur,</hi> what reſentments ſoever he had for the Marſhal <hi>de Ornano</hi>'s impriſonment, as alſo by <hi>Monſieur</hi> the Prince of <hi>Condy,</hi> whom he had perſwaded the Queen Mother to <hi>Careſſe;</hi> not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all her averſions from it, that he might ingage him in his Majeſties in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts, and divert him from taking part with thoſe of the Cabal. From thence it was, that <hi>Monſieur</hi> the Cardinal writ to his Majeſty, beſeeching him, that he would be pleaſed to let him withdraw himſelf. He preſented to him, that for his own part he never had any other deſigns in his ſervice, then his glory and the good of his State; but was now extreamly much diſcontented to find the Court divided upon his occaſion, and the fire of diſſention ready to flame out, and all with deſign for his ruine. That he would little eſteem his life, if imployed in his Majeſties ſervice, and for the good of his Crown; but that it could not but trouble him, to ſee him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf baſely Butchered in the midſt of the Court, as it was almoſt impoſſible for him to avoid it, he being every day attended by a multitude of men, whom he knew not, and not having any one near him, who could defend him from any violence which might be offered to him, that in caſe his Majeſties pleaſure were ſuch, that he would command him to continue neer him, and in this danger he would moſt gladly obey him without the leaſt repugnancy, becauſe there was not any thing which he would prefer before his Majeſties Will. But the confidence he had that his Majeſty could not take any delight to behold him, ending his dayes by ſuch a death, to which he could not be expoſed, but his Majeſty muſt remain injured and offended; did ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige him to think good to retire himſelf from the Court. He added, that his want of health too which was much impaired, by that great concourſe of people, with which he was dayly over-preſſed; did make him beleeve, he could not long hold out in the management of Affairs, and that his Majeſty had ſo much the more reaſon to grant him his requeſt, in regard his weakneſſe would in a little while make him uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe in his ſervice.</p>
                  <p>He writ to the ſame effect unto the Queen Mother, and begged her to imploy her
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:56802:71"/>Power with his Majeſty to obtain his requeſts. But their Majeſties were ſo far from having the leaſt inclination to admit of his retirement; that on the contrary, the King openly declared, he would never give his conſent to it, he being ſenſible enough of thoſe great happineſſes which he had procured to the Kingdom alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, of that credit and eſteem, which he had raiſed his Arms unto amongſt ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, of the ſubmiſſion to which he had reduced the Heretiques, of the good Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which he had eſtabliſhed in the Treaſuries, and of the great height whereunto he had advanced the Authority of his Scepter. The Queen Mother too, conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring over and above theſe reaſons which were not unknown to her what a loſſe it is to a State, to be deprived of a grand Miniſter, how uſefull the Cardinal was to her Counſels and Intereſts, at the ſame inſtant reſolved to oppoſe his removal, ſo that it was by their common advices concluded to command him, no longer to think of abſenting himſelf, and to let him know that his ſervices were too well known, to procure an aſſent for his departure; and laſtly, that he need not be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted at the ſenſe of thoſe wicked deſigns which were contrived againſt him, nor at the inconveniences which he ſuffered in point of health, for that it were eaſie to remedy both one and t'other. <hi>Monſieur</hi> the Cardinal who prefers nothing in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of their Majeſties will and pleaſure, ſubmitted all his reſolutions accordingly. The King too, that he might provide for the ſafety both of his life and health, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned Guards to him, who were to wait on him every where, and defend him from any attempts of his enemies, he commanded the <hi>Sieur de Folain,</hi> to have an eſpecial care, that his health were not prejudiced by the multitude of people who made addreſſes to him, but that entrance were onely permitted unto ſuch as had occaſion to ſpeak with him, about ſome urgent Affairs. Theſe Proviſions of the King were ſo many certain teſtimonies of the good Will, which his Majeſty did bear towards him, and I think that the honour he got in this Action, was more conſiderable then all the reſt; for by it he evinced to the whole Nation, that hee was not tied to the Court; but onely for his Majeſties ſervice, and that his own par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular intreſts and concerns were not valued at all by him.</p>

                  <p>IT is impoſſible to prevent that the ſplendour of an extraordinary vertue, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured by a Prince with a great power, ſhould not raiſe up the Envy of thoſe who have never ſo little Ambition in them. The Sun doth not more naturally attract divers vapours from the earth, which afterwards become Clouds and darken his light, then a grand Miniſter doth ordinarily ſee his own merit, and the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of his <hi>Genius</hi> draw upon him the hatred of the Grandees, that they make uſe of factions and diviſions againſt him. We have elſewhere ſaid, that Fortune was never yet ſeen to defend them from this infelicity, and I ſhal now adde that the cheef and ready way for great men to exempt themſelves from the blame and the troubles which envy may ſtir up againſt them, is to manifeſt, that their medling in affairs of Publique concern, is free from all manner of ſelf-intereſt, which may eaſily be done, by their deſiring to withdraw themſelves from the trouble of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, to lead a private life. This moderation will ſtop the mouths of the moſt imbittered men, who after this, cannot find any thing to object againſt the power wherewith they are honoured, and are forced to convert their hatred into admiration. <hi>Lucullus</hi> finding that the glory of his Triumph, had laid him open to the hatred of ſome leading men in the Common-wealth, withdrew himſelf from the management of Publick affairs, to ſpend the time in ſtudying of Arts; but he was inſtantly intreated by the wiſer ſort, not to follow his own inclinations in that particular, and at ſuch a time, for it was not unknown, that he was only able to curb the ambition of <hi>Pompey.</hi> And <hi>Auguſtus</hi> (as <hi>Suetonius</hi> reporteth) did often de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to quit the Empire, when he found how difficult it was to deal with the people of <hi>Rome.</hi> The Pope <hi>St. Gregory</hi> the Great, in the like manner, knowing that the courſe of his life, did offend many perſons, who could not indure that his exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:56802:72"/>ſhould oblige them to live retiredly and reſervedly, and had deſigned to chuſe another Pope in his place, he declared to them; that he for his part ſhould be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much afflicted to find any ſtorms ariſe in the Church upon his ſcore, and that he would much more willingly ſurrender the Government, then ſee any Schiſm ariſe amongſt them. But this his modeſty and humility, repreſented him ſo venerable a perſon, that thoſe very men, who did not reſent his Government, were obliged to acknowledge the greatneſſe of his worth. Laſtly, although it be commendable in a great States man to make ſhew of ſuch moderation, to the end he may ſilence that Envy to which he is expoſed; yet a King is bound to make ſome difficulty in aſcenting to his retirement, on ſuch an occaſion. No Counſel can better bee followed, then that of the wiſe man (who ſaid) he who hath found a faithfull ſervant, ought to cheriſh him like his Soul, and to eſteem him as a brother; and it cannot be denied, but that to deprive a Kingdome of the aſſiſtance and guidance of a Soul highly generous and underſtanding, were to take away the Sun from it, and to fill it with horrour and confuſion.</p>

                  <head>The Impriſonment of the Duke <hi>de Vendoſm,</hi> and the Grand Prior of <hi>France</hi> his Brother, at <hi>Blois.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>IT had been little to the purpoſe, barely to have impriſoned the Marſhal <hi>de Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nano,</hi> if ſome others too of the chief Complices had not been ſecured, and eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially, the Grand Prior, who was much to be feared, he being a perſon of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter abilities to carry on a deſign then all the reſt. His Brother too, the Duke of <hi>Vondoſm</hi> was not to be neglected, conſidering the intelligence which his Majeſty had but newly received of his indeavours, to withdraw the people from the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence which they owe to his Crown: That he had cauſed himſelf to be called <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur</hi> the Duke without any other Title: That he had commanded this form of Prayer to be uſed in the Church, <hi>Pro famulo tuo duce, domino noſtro:</hi> That he had ſundry times attempted by money to corrupt the <hi>Sieur de Cange,</hi> then Lievtenant of the Caſtle of <hi>Nants:</hi> That he felt the Pulſe of the Nobility, the Parliament, and Chamber of Accompt, that he might the better fortifie himſelf in the Province; an intelligence which ought ſo much the more to be looked into, in regard two brothers do not uſually enter upon any great deſign, but by a joynt conſent; that ſome pretenſions they might have (though weak ones) upon <hi>Britain,</hi> and that nothing doth ſooner ingage great men in the Factions of a Court then Ambition. Now although it was very needfull to arreſt him, yet it was difficult to be done in <hi>Brittain,</hi> by reaſon of the great Power he held there, ſo it was thought fit to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw him, and ingage him to wait upon his Majeſty upon ſome pretence or other. No way was imagined to be more expedient for it, then to work upon the Grand Prior, by feeding him with hopes of the Admiralty, concerning which he was to treat with the <hi>Sieur de Montmorancy,</hi> or at leaſt by perſwading him that in caſe that charge were taken away, as it was then intended, he was the onely man who ſhould have the Commiſſion to diſcharge that Office.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Propoſals were made to him, with ſo much addreſſe, that they made ſure of him, and abſolutely convinced him that there was not any ſuſpicion in the leaſt of him, and the King going to <hi>Blois,</hi> where it was not known that he intended to paſſe on any further, his Majeſty told him how glad he ſhould be, that the Duke of <hi>Vendoſm</hi> would come to him, ſo hee preſently tooke upon himſelfe to goe to him, and to perſwade him to come and pay all ſignes of obedience <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

Some have ſaid, that hee being doubtfull, leſt his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty had already conceived ſome apprehenſions againſt the Duke of <hi>Vendoſm,</hi> did demand aſſurance for his bringing him to his Majeſty at <hi>Blois,</hi> and that his Prudence returned ſuch an anſwer, which though it obliged him to nothing, yet it gave the Grand Prior ſatisfaction enough to ingage the Duke to undertake the journey. I paſſe my word to you (quoth the King, as is reported) that he may come to me,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:56802:72"/>and that he ſhall have no more hurt done him then your ſelf, though for my part I cannot but much doubt of this particular paſſage; but true it is he went from the Court and ſhortly after brought the Duke his Brother with him to <hi>Blois,</hi> where his Majeſty received them with ſo many, embraces and endearments, that they could not in the leaſt ſuſpect the reſolution which was taken for ſecuring of their perſons.</p>
                  <p>Before I proceed to the manner of their being taken. I cannot but obſerve, how very receſſary it is, that the Chief Offices of the adminiſtration, be ſupplied with perſons of courage as well as of Integrity, The King ſent for the ſeal to the Lord <hi>Chancelor Haligie,</hi> the very ſame day that the <hi>Grant Prior</hi> went to fetch the Duke of <hi>Vendoſme.</hi> The Honeſtie of his Miniſter was not unknown to all the world, but it could not be denied, that his mind was low and full of fear which he did ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly make appear<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> wen as upon the taking of the Marſhal <hi>d'Ornano,</hi> he had not the courage to juſtifie his Majeſties counſels in that particular before <hi>Monſieur,</hi> although the thing it ſelf were one of the moſt important accidents, that had a long time happened for the good of the State. This paſſion of timerouſneſs, is a very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper quality in a ſupream Miniſter of Juſtice, who is bound to make head againſt all wickedneſs, and not only that, but alſo to uſe courage and force to reſiſt and overcome it; this was it which obliged his Majeſty to take the ſeal from him, and to intruſt it with the <hi>Sieur de Marillac,</hi> ſuperintendent of the treaſury, whoſe loyaltie was then in great credit amongſt all well affected men, and who had teſtified a great deal of reſoluteneſs in the diſpatch of thoſe affairs which preſented them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves unto him. The ſuper-intendency was beſtowed on the <hi>Monſieur d'Effiat,</hi> whoſe judgment and diſcret conduct was well known in ſundry occaſions, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly in the late affair of the Match with <hi>England.</hi> But that I may now return, to the two Brothers, who were come to wait on this Majeſty at <hi>Bloys,</hi> his Majeſty be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing retired to his bed, ſent about two howers after mid night to find out the <hi>Sieurs d'Hallier</hi> and the Marquis <hi>de Moicy,</hi> Captains of his Guards, and commanded them to go into their Chambers, and make ſure of their perſons; accordingly they ſeized on them and it is reported that, the Duke of <hi>Vendoſm,</hi> beginning firſt to ſpeak ſhould ſay, looking on his Brother, well Brother, did not I tell you in <hi>Britain,</hi> that we ſhould be arreſted? and that the Grand Prior ſhould anſwer, would I were dead, upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition you were ſafe there again, and then that the Duke ſhould reply. I told you the truth when I ſaid the Caſtle of <hi>Blois</hi> was a place fatal to Princes. They then made a thouſand excuſes, each telling the other that he was the cauſe of their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment, and that they themſelves confeſſed, that they were adviſed that even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by a letter how they ſhould be impriſoned, but that they could not believe it. That whole morning, they had liberty to disburthen their miracles by their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, of the misfortune in which they found themſelves imbroyled. Afterward they were carried to the Caſtle of <hi>Amboyſe,</hi> and thence to the <hi>Bois de Vincennes.</hi> This blow gave the allarum to the whoſe Cabal, though his Majeſty who would content himſelf with puniſhing of ſome few, pretended to be ignorant of the reſt: He alſo ſent a commiſſion to the Count <hi>de Soiſſons,</hi> to command during his abſence in and about <hi>Paris,</hi> for the ſecuring of it. It's true he would not truſt himſelf there, but choſe rather to paſſe away, ſome little time either in <hi>Savoy</hi> or <hi>Italy.</hi> A cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Princeſs took the boldneſs to ſay unto ſome who went to viſit her that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the aſſurance, which the King had given to the <hi>Grand Prior,</hi> in behalf of his Brother the Duke of <hi>Vendoſm,</hi> yet that both of them were arreſted; which did clearly evince, that thoſe were near his Majeſty did perſwade him to break his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes; which being reported to the King, it is ſaid he was pleaſed to anſwer, that the was not well informed of the whole paſſage, and that he was not concerned to entertain ſuch diſcourſe, for that if they knew themſelves innocent, they would never have thought of demanding a ſecurity to come and wait upon him: and that who ſo doeth require an aſſurance for his attending on his Soveraign, doeth in effect condemn himſelf to be guilty, and that the promiſes which are made on ſuch an occaſion ought not to be his warrant, unleſſe they be very clear and expreſſe to that purpoſe.</p>

To puniſh them and hinder their troubling the repoſe of the Kingdom, cannot be denied for an Act of Juſtice, which if it cannot be done but by giving them fair hopes and good words to a muſe them, then ſuch means are to be made uſe of accordingly, provided alwayes, that there be no expreſſe promiſe granted unto them.

I know there are ſome <hi>Politicians,</hi> who are of opinion that there need not any great care be taken concerning performance of promiſes, nay not thoſe which are abſolute and expreſſe, though made by Princes in the way of aſſurance and ſecurity; and that it is ſufficient for them to anſwer thoſe who ſhall complain of the breach of them, as <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> did a friend, who taxed him upon a promiſe, which he afterwards had found to be unreaſonable. If what you demand be Juſt, I have promiſed it, but if it be unjuſt, I am not obliged to be as good as my word, and when he was anſwered that a Prince, ought to perform whatever he promiſeth, yes Quoth he, and a ſubject ought not to requeſt any thing of his Soveraign which is unreaſonable. But for my particular I am of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that a Prince is obliged inviolably to obſerve all expreſſe promiſes, and that it is only permited to his Miniſters for Juſtice ſake to be leſſe then their words. I ſhould rather imagine that a Prince ſhould on ſuch occaſions make uſe of all vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent means, rather then deluſions, becauſe Force is reputed for a vertue, when backed by authority, and nothing can be alleadged againſt it; whereas deceipt can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be taken for any other thing, then a kind of mallice unbecoming the Majeſty of a Soveraign.</p>

                  <p>UPon the Duke of <hi>Vendoſm's</hi> impriſonment, it was miſtruſted leaſt divers per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, whom he had won to his Intereſts in <hi>Brittain</hi> might ſtir up ſome Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion with hopes to enforce the King to grant him his liberty; but as his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties preſence only was ſufficient, to deprive them both of the means and liberty to do ſo, he went to <hi>Nantes,</hi> and ſhortly after ſummoned all the States to meet there, where ſuch as were any wayes ſuſpected were not ſuffered to appear. The King was pleaſed to be perſonally preſent at their firſt Aſſembly, and the Lord keeper gave them to underſtand, that his Majeſties deſign, was only to conſider of what means and wayes were moſt proper for ſetling the peace of that Province, which was the principal thing there debated, and at laſt it was ſo happily concluded by the Kings Authority, and the Prudent conduct of the Marſhal <hi>de Themines,</hi> (to whom his Majeſty had committed the Government of it upon the Duke of <hi>Vendoſm's</hi> impriſonment) that there did not any difficulties ariſe in it. The chief means to ſettle all was to diſarm ſuch as were ſuſpected, and to deliver them to others who were known to be right and honeſt. To deſtroy ſome ſtrong places, many of which belonged to the Duke of <hi>Vendoſme,</hi> and ſerved only to countenance a revolt. Which being thus ended, The King began to debate with the Queen Mother and his Counſellours, whether it were proper to marry <hi>Monſieur</hi> or not; for that was one of the main pretexts of the Cabal, who had endeavoured to poſſeſſe <hi>Monſieur</hi> with the opinion, That having no other liberty or freedome, he might chuſe his own wife, and in that particular follow his own inclinations; but it was eaſie to undeceive him, by laying before him, how the liberty incident to Marriages was civil, that it is ordered by the Laws of the Kingdome, which do prohibit any Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to marry themſelves, without the Kings conſent, and that he for his part could not do better then to be governed by the King, who loved him very dearly, and would undoubtedly match him, which ſuch a perſon as would be moſt proper for him. Divers reaſons were urged both of the one and t'other part, all ſorts of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts were conſidered with great deliberation, and all the conſequences incident upon his marrying or not marrying, were examined to the full, and in concluſion the King of his own motion ſaid, he indeed apprehended ſeveral reaſons which were ſufficient to take him off from any thoughts of marrying him, but with all that the Quiet of his State, ſeeming to oblige him to marry him, he reſolved to do accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly: That his intentions in it being good, he could not but hope Heaven would bleſſe it with good ſucceſſe; and in caſe the enemies of the publique Peace ſhould attempt to raiſe contrary effects out of it, that he had power enough in his hand to remedy and defend it.</p>
                  <p>It is reported, That <hi>Monſieur</hi> the Cardinal, did only repreſent to his Majeſty thoſe reaſons, which might ſeem either to invite or diſſwade the marrying of him, without inclining more to the one then to the other, as well becauſe he knew his Majeſty to be prudent enough, and not to want any advices in what did ſo neerly concern the power of his Authority, as alſo becauſe it was a buſineſs in which his Majeſty ought to follow his own will and pleaſure, and was not obliged to conclude off or on but with his own ſatisfaction and content, it is very dangerous to ſecond too ſtrongly ſuch counſels, whoſe effects are lyable to the changes of Fortune, and it were a great folly for a man to think himſelf ſafe and ſure, of that, which is often perverted by the wickedneſs of ſome men, who by it raiſe advantages to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
                  <p>At laſt it being generally reſolved, the Queen mother paſſionately deſirous, that <hi>Monſieur</hi> ſhould marry <hi>Madamoiſelle de Montpenſier,</hi> ſent to <hi>Madam de G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="136" facs="tcp:56802:74"/>was then living, and the young Prince dying about the year one thouſand ſix hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and eleven, both the King and Queen Mother, had paſs'd their words to marry her to <hi>Monſieur</hi> who was to ſucceed in the quality of Duke of <hi>Orleans.</hi> Both being now of an age fit to be married; <hi>Madam de Guiſe</hi> did oftentimes urge that the promiſes which had been made to her, might be performed, and <hi>Monſieur</hi> who had alwayes preſerved himſelf, in a total reſignation of his own to the Kings will, was the more eaſily induced to effect it, in regard of thoſe moſt excellent qualities wherewith Heaven had bleſſed both the Perſon and mind of that Princeſſe; but however, the liberty which is uſually permitted to Princes of his age, did allay the over haſty execution of it neither did his Majeſty preſſe it, until he had diſcovered by the dangerouſneſs of the Cabal, that one of the onely means to ſhop the farther progreſs of them, was to haſten on his marriage. The King did not approve of his marrying any Forraign Princeſſe, leaſt it might prove an in-let for Factions in the State, and leaſt it might open a dore for ſtrangers to invade the Kingdome, as often as they would raiſe any diſcontents to themſelves; but he liked well of this Match with <hi>Madamoiſelle de Montpenſier,</hi> her Birth and vertue rendring her worthy to be admitted into the Royal family. The Queen Mother, who could not be heartily perſwaded to love <hi>Monſieur</hi> the Prince did not like of the Match between his Daughter <hi>Madamoiſelle de Bourbonne,</hi> and <hi>Monſieur,</hi> though the Cabal did much drive it on: Withal <hi>Madamoiſelle de Montpenſier</hi> being left ſole inheritrix of her whole houſe, was extreamly rich, and would very well ſerve to make up <hi>Monſieurs</hi> affairs, as alſo eaſe the Exchequer of great Penſions which otherwiſe muſt of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity be beſtowed on him. They of the Cabal were vexed at heart, to find things ſo carried on, but they were neceſſitated to be quiet and to hold their peaces too<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Shortly after, the King declared ſome part of his thoughts to <hi>Monſieur,</hi> who an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered him that if it were his Majeſties pleaſure to marry him there, he ſhould to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally reſign himſelf to his Majeſties will; By which and in ſeveral other occaſion, he hath alwayes ſhewed, That Heaven did with his birth infuſe into him extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary reſpects for the King, which had doubtleſſe inſeperably linked him to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, had not the mallicious devices of thoſe, in whom he placed ſome confidence diverted him. <hi>Monſieur</hi> ſent <hi>M. le Coigneux</hi> his <hi>Chancellor</hi> to <hi>Madam de Guiſe,</hi> to aſſure her of his kindneſſes, and particularly of the affection which he had to conclude the Match, between himſelf and <hi>Madamoiſelle</hi> her daughter, and charging him afterwards to wait upon <hi>Madamoiſelle de Montpenſier,</hi> he commanded him to aſſure her on his behalf, that he would be a better Husband, then he had been a Servant, He was received with a great deal of Honour, both by one and t'other, and with as many teſtimonies of joy, as the modeſty of that ſex could allow of, and the next day <hi>Madamoiſelle de Montpenſier</hi> going to wait on the Queen Mother, the called her Daughter, and made her ſit down neer to her. To conclude, the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage was celebrated ſoon after to the quiet and content of the whole Kingdome: And thus the King aſſiſted by the ſage counſels of <hi>Monſieur</hi> the Cardinal, did diſpel all thoſe ſmall contrivances which were deſigned to oppoſe it, and brought to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing all the Cabals which divers Princes and Lords of Court had projected upon that occaſion, both with <hi>England, Spain, Holland</hi> and ſome places of <hi>Italy,</hi> with the Hugonots, nay with the very houſhold Servants of his Majeſty, and ſome of them were ſuch as had neereſt acceſſe to his perſon.</p>

                  <p>THe Marriages of Princes of the Blood ought to be contracted with a great deal of freedome, ſeeing that liberty is an eſſential part of marriage; but they ought to be mindful, that this ſame liberty doth not conſiſt in a power of marrying whom they pleace, and when &amp; upon what terms they think fit. Liberty in general (as <hi>Vlpian</hi> ſaith) conſiſteth barely of a power to do what the Laws do permitt, and ſpeaking more particularly concerning Marriages, he ſaith; That the Liberty which Lawyers do allow of, can be grounded upon no other thing then the meer power, of contracting
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:56802:74"/>ones ſelf in that manner as the Laws do approve of. And the old Law allowed of none to be legitimate, but ſuch as were conformable to the Laws of the State. Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Liberty keeps a <hi>medium</hi> between thoſe two extremities of ſervitude and licenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, and is neither one or t'other of them; for as it hath no abſolute depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance upon Slavery; ſo is it alſo limited by Laws not to do whatever it ſhall think fit; it conſiſteth in a Liberty of doing that which is juſtifiable by the Law, whence it follows, that the Princes of the Blood in <hi>France,</hi> being by a fundamental Law pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited to marry without the Kings permiſſion, they are deprived of the Liberty to conclude any match upon their own heads or power. The great <hi>St. Baſil</hi> ſaith in the firſt letter which he writ to <hi>Amphilochius,</hi> that thoſe contracts which are made by them who are not maſters of themſelves, ought to be eſteemed for void, if not confirmed by the power upon which they depend. But what may bee the reaſon hereof? It cannot be ſaid that they are not voluntary, for then they could not be termed contracts, which is ſo evidently clear, that it cannot be denied; but however it is true, they are not concluded with the Civil Freedome, that is, not guided by the Law, and for that reaſon cannot be accompted valid. The reaſon of this Cuſtome is grounded upon a Maxime of Law, which ſaith, what belongeth to us cannot be taken away without our conſents, whence it followeth that thoſe who depend upon another, and who have not any thing which doth not belong to thoſe upon whom they depend have not any lawfull power to diſpoſe of themſelves, and in caſe they ſhould do it, it were only an Act of licentiouſneſſe, and is declared void by Law. Moreover, what <hi>St. Baſil</hi> ſaith, ſpeaking of Contracts in general; in his firſt, he doth more particularly ſet forth, concerning his marriage in his ſecond let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, when he declareth in expreſſe terms: That ſuch marriages as are made without the Authority of thoſe upon whom they depend are abſolute Fornications, of which no other reaſon can be given then this, that they who contracted themſelves did not conſent to it with a lawfull power, and that they could not diſpoſe of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, in regard of their dependency upon a ſuperior Authority. He who is not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of himſelf, cannot give himſelf to a wife, and it will neceſſarily follow from thence, that the marriages of the Princes of the Blood of <hi>France,</hi> cannot be eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med valid, when they are not accompanied with their Kings conſents, for that they do abſolutely depend upon their Majeſties.</p>

The King had good reaſon to be offended at it, yet his Clemency carried him on to command the Cardinal onely to tell him, that he did run counter to thoſe proteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Fidelity which he had formerly made, that his Contrivances were better known then he was aware off, and that he ſhould be carefull of his Actions. <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lais</hi> was informed at the ſame time by others, that the King was angry with him, and finding himſelf guilty, he deſired to diſcourſe with <hi>Monſieur</hi> the Cardinal to diſguiſe his faults.

He ſeemed to be very ready to withdraw himſelf from thoſe imbroyls, and alſo took occaſions to ſpeak unto the King, whiles he was ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of him ready, to aſſure him that he would never be defective in his duty; yet notwithſtanding all this, his turbulent Soul was not able to contain it ſelf in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution; for it was known, that a certain meſſenger ſent by ſome one from the Cabal, was kept private in his lodging at <hi>Tours,</hi> while the King ſtayed there, and that <hi>Louviece</hi> who belonged to him, being one in whom he much confided, was gone upon a private meſſage for him, theſe things gave reaſon to beleeve.

And it is very neceſſary for them to puniſh the factions, without which they would be hourly expoſed to the dangers of civil war, which are the cauſe of the greateſt misfortunes, that can afflict a State. And the ſame Philoſopher in his Morals, eſteemeth him uncapable to command, who is never angry, but affects to ſhew himſelf merciful, on all occaſions whatſoever. To ſpeak truth, a King is bound to ſhew as much ſeverity to them, whom the publique Intereſt obligeth to be cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſed, as bounty to them that keep themſelf within their duties.

                  <p>THe King comitted the tryal of <hi>Chalais</hi> rather to a Chamber of Juſtice than any private Court not onely becauſe he would have it expedited, it being improper to be delayed, but alſo to keep private the names of his Confiderates and their deſigns, which were dangerous to be publiſhed. His Majeſty made the Lord keeper <hi>Marillac</hi> Preſident, and appointed for Judges the <hi>Sieurs de Cuſſe</hi> and <hi>Brie</hi> Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents of the Parliament of <hi>Britain,</hi> The <hi>Sieurs Fonquet</hi> Marchant, <hi>Chriqueville</hi> Maſter of Requeſt, and ſix Councellors of the Parliament of <hi>Britain.</hi> They met ſeveral times for inſtruction of the Proceſſe. <hi>Chalais</hi> was often times examined, and having found by diſcourſe with ſeveral people with whom he converſed, that there was full information made of all his wicked deſigns, he confeſſed not onely what was conteined in <hi>Monſieurs</hi> Declaration, but withal divers other things of which <hi>Lorrain</hi> accuſed him, and which were teſtified by <hi>Monſieur de Bellegarde, Le Sieur d'Effiat,</hi> by the Mauſt exempt, who had the charge of his perſon, and by one of the Life-guard, to all which he made no denial being brought face to face. He diſcovered the Major part of his Aſſociates, he confeſſed that he would have carried <hi>Monſieur</hi> from the Court, that he would have perſwaded him to take up arms, to hold Intelligence with the Governours and Hugonots, to make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf Maſter of <hi>Havre, Mets,</hi> and diverſe other places of the Kingdome, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al that being once at a Council, where the grand Prior and thoſe of his faction were preſent, he propoſed to them to take the Marſhal <hi>d'Ornano</hi> out of priſon, to poniard the Cardinal, and then to fly into <hi>Flanders;</hi> thinking that this once done, they might eaſily obtain all their deſires. There were ſeveral other charges pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced againſt him, and amongſt others, certain letters from the <hi>Sieur de Moiſon</hi> the Kings Reſident with the Counteſſe of <hi>Hanault</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> and of the <hi>Sieur de Vatembourg</hi> his Majeſties Reſident with the Emperour, by which they gave advice of the Marſhal <hi>d'Ornano's</hi> conſpiracy, of certain letters which <hi>Chalais</hi> had writ to the Dutcheſſe <hi>de Chevreuſe</hi> in <hi>Biſcay,</hi> in which there were diſcourſes to the Kings diſhonour, and alſo certain letters in characters to the ſame Lady, the Declaration of <hi>Monſieur</hi> the Kings Brother, and the informations of the Vice-Seneſchal <hi>de Moulins.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe enermous crimes rendred him guilty and worthy of death, in regard he was the Kings Domeſtique Servant, and that he had the honour to be in a charge, which obliged him to be alwayes near his Majeſties perſon. Juſtice could not ſave him, and the ſeveral relapſes, which proceeded from the fierceneſſe and ambition of his Spirit, tied up the Kings Arms from mercy. So this Chamber of Juſtice con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned him to be attainted and convicted <hi>decrimine leſae Majeſtatis,</hi> and to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed in the <hi>Befroy</hi> of <hi>Nantes;</hi> That his head ſhould be put upon a ſpear over the
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:56802:76"/>gate of <hi>Sanvetour,</hi> that his body ſhould be quartered into four parts, and hung upon the four principal places of the City, that his poſterity ſhould be ignoble and of the Yeomantry; His houſes raized, and that for the farther diſcovery of all his Abettors, he ſhould be put on the Rack. But the Kings clemency, ſeconded by the affection, which he alwayes had for him, moderated the judgment, and onely commanded his head to be cut off, and that they ſhould ſhew him the Rack, but not torture him.</p>
                  <p>They, who underſtood not, that the whole Intreague was diſcovered, or that there were ſufficient poofs to convict him, were aſtoniſhed, that he ſhould ſo freely confeſſe thoſe crimes, whereof he was accuſed, and withal ſome were ſo bold, to report, that he had confeſſed his crimes thus frankly, upon the Cardinals ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtian, and perſwading him to believe, that it was the onely means to obtain the Kings favour, the attainment of which, he gave him great cauſe to hope for. But there need no other proof for conviction of this lye, than the anſwer which <hi>Chalais</hi> made to the <hi>Sieurs des Cartes &amp; de Lourie, Councellors</hi> of the <hi>Parliament,</hi> both perſons of a clear reputation, and entruſted to exame him: after judgment had paſſed upon him; who having told him, that a report was ſpread abroad, that he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed his crimes wherewith he was charged, partly through fear and partly through hope of life, conjured him, he being now ſhortly to render an account of his actions before God, to diſcover, if it were ſo or not, or if he had impeached any one in prejudice to the truth and his conſcience; and had no other anſwer from him, but that, what he had ſaid, was truth, excepting onely, where he had in anger ſpoke too hardly againſt <hi>Madam de Chevreuſe,</hi> who had given him no reaſon for it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that he ſhould be very wicked and ſenceleſſe to diſcover ſo many horrible crimes, to clear himſelf and charge innocent perſons, and all for the ſatisfaction of another mans paſſion. This proof was ſo much the more certain, in regard it proceeded from the laſt paſſages of his life, in which he teſtified, that he would diſpoſe himſelf by a true repentance, to obtain pardon from God of his faults. There was hereupon great reaſon to admire the Kings clemency, ſeeing that he might in juſtice impriſon and puniſh diverſe Grandees of the Court, whom he had accuſed, who were no ſmall number; but his Majeſty in ſtead of Publiſhing their deſign was pleaſed to puniſh all their great faults in one man onely, keeping ſome in priſon and ſending <hi>Madam de Chevreuſe</hi> into <hi>Lorraine,</hi> not having ground to hope that ſhe could live in the Court and not raiſe new broyles.</p>

                  <p>ALthough it be expedient to detect the chief contrivers of a compiracy either againſt the Publique quiet or their Kings perſon, yet wiſe Politicians have not thought it proper, to prey too exactly into all the complices, or the plot it ſelf, if any great number of potent leading men have ingaged in it. It being to be feared, leaſt either their quality or number, might draw others in, or that the pretences of their deſign might be ſo ſpecious, that many perſons might be concerned in it, who never knew at all the true depth of the buſineſs. It was upon this accompt, that the Senate of <hi>Rome,</hi> condemned <hi>Lucius Vectius,</hi> and <hi>Tarquinius</hi> for diſcovering, that <hi>Caeſar</hi> and <hi>Creſſus,</hi> were parties in <hi>Catalines</hi> conſpiracie, it being by them feared, and that with reaſon, leaſt a greater number who were admirers of thoſe two eminent perſons, might betake themſelves to the ſame party: A little diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling upon ſuch an occaſion, will be more, then the ſtricteſt inquiſition as <hi>Pompey</hi> made appear, upon <hi>Sertorius</hi> his death; for <hi>Perpenna</hi> having ſent him a great cheſt full of Letters, which the <hi>Romans</hi> had ſent to <hi>Sertorius,</hi> ingaging themſelves in his quarrel, he would not read one of them but caſt them all into the fire, fearing leaſt inſtead of one <hi>Sertorius,</hi> twenty might ſpring up in <hi>Rome,</hi> when they ſhould find themſelves diſcovered; and for his part it was not his deſire to force, or oblige them by violence to unite themſelves together, for their own defence. Thus <hi>Alexander,</hi> having intercepted ſome of <hi>Darius</hi> his letters, by which he had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged

                  <p>THe Court of <hi>France</hi> was not the only Scean, of Factions: <hi>England</hi> was no leſſe peſtered with imbroyles by thoſe diviſions which happened between the King and Queen, but ended by the returning into <hi>France,</hi> all the Queens officers, though by the Articles of marriage it had been concluded, That her Majeſty ſhould be attended by officers who were French and Catholiques. But it was moſt certain, the Engliſh never intended long to keep them, which they ſufficiently ſhewed, by the entertainment, given them at <hi>Dover,</hi> where they could hardly get meat for their mony, and ſoon after their arrival, they laid hold on ſeveral occaſions to put what that had concluded on in execution. It is reported that ſome Eccleſiaſtiques and women, did ſow jealouſies and diſcontents between the King and Queen, which exaſperated the King very much againſt them, whereupon the Duke of <hi>Buc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kingham</hi> deſigned that his Wife, Siſter, and Niece, might be her Bed-chamber Women, which being contrarie to the Articles of Marriage, which did prohibit any to bear office in the Queen's Family, who were not Catholiques, it was denied him; which angered him the more, in regard he had uſed to diſpoſe of all affairs in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> with a great deal of Authority: It was indeed propoſed not long after to do that Honour to his Mother, who was a Catholique, and to his Wife, who was that way inclined, but he being unſatisfied with it, did from that time forward uſe his utmoſt endeavours, to foment and revenge it. But it is on the other ſide reported, that <hi>Madam de Cheuureuſe,</hi> diſcontented in the French Court, and having got a good acquaintance in <hi>England,</hi> blew the Coales of this diviſion, only to be revenged; and withal that <hi>Buckingham,</hi> was much blamed by the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> for having admitted of divers Articles the Treaty of Marriage, which were prejudicial, to the Religion of the Country, and threatned to be called to an accompt, for a vaſt ſumme of mony, which was pretended he had diverted to his own uſe.</p>
                  <p>Now to ſatisfie the Parliament, who are of great power in <hi>England,</hi> he made it his buſineſs to fall upon the Catholiques, eſpecially the Queens officers, and all that he might teſtifie to the Parliament, how he would conform himſelf to their pleaſure in every thing: But he was vexed moſt of all when he went into <hi>Holland,</hi> upon ſome affairs, with deſign to paſſe to the Court of <hi>France,</hi> and the King gave the King of <hi>England</hi> to underſtand, that he did not like of the Journy; The Earle of <hi>Holland</hi> too, did not a little ſet on thoſe diviſions, for that the French, who were neer the Queen, had hindred him from being over-ſeer of her Majeſties Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue, and had perſwaded her to beſtow that place upon the Biſhop of <hi>Mande,</hi> which exaſperated him very much, ſo that he made uſe of his power both with the King, and <hi>Bukingham,</hi> to drive on the buſineſs to ſuch a height, that it was at laſt concluded, that all her Majeſties officers ſhould be returned into <hi>France,</hi> which was accordingly performed, and about the beginning of Auguſt, they were forced to croſſe the Sea.</p>

                  <p>IT is Common upon the marrying of great Princeſſes with a Forraign King, to give them officers of their own Country, but it is ſeldome ſeen, that they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue any long time neer them. It cannot be avoided, but that there will jealouſies and heart burnings ariſe between them and the Natives of the Country, concerning their enjoying thoſe offices, which they believe are due to themſelves? which jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie doth uſually raiſe ſuch ſtorms; that their ruine is included in it: but admit, no jealouſie did ariſe, yet the meer diverſity of their language and Cuſtomes, were enough to create differences and diviſions between them; Forraign officers cannot forbear diſcourſing together in their own language, which createth ſuſpitions in thoſe who underſtand it not. By reaſon of the diverſity of their faſhions, they laugh at one another, which commonly breeds quarrels between them; and withall, let a man be never ſo complaiſant in his humour, yet there is alwayes a jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous eye upon them, that they contrive ſome thing againſt the State. Of this, there are divers examples in all times, as particularly in the raign of <hi>Francis</hi> the firſt, in which <hi>Bellay</hi> reporteth that Affairs were very much imbroyled by ſtrangers, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancing, the Biſhop of <hi>Liege,</hi> the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> the Marquis of <hi>Mantua,</hi> and <hi>Andreas Doria;</hi> hence <hi>Bodin</hi> in his Commonwealth, doeth much blame the <hi>Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians,</hi> for admitting of all kind of ſtrangers amongſt them, <hi>Lypſius</hi> obſerveth, That as when many crickets come into a houſe, it is one aſſured ſign, of their ſodaine de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, ſo when a great multitude of ſtrangers ſhall live in a Nation, it is a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, Index of ſome revolution neer at hand. Indeed, they have not uſually any great deal of affection, for the Country where they live, ſo that they do not heartily embrace the Intereſts of it, and in caſe a war ſhould break out, none would be ſo ready as they to entertain intelligence and give advices to the enemies. They are alſo eaſily provoked againſt the natural inhabitants of the Country, upon any ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpition, that they are leſſe eſteemed by them, then others, which induceth them to ſtick cloſe together and to raiſe Factions againſt the State: withal their bodies may not be puniſhed, though there be ſome kind of reaſon for it, leaſt they ſhould ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally reſent it, and raiſe up a thouſand Broyles. Theſe are the chief reaſons why it is impoſſible to preſerve a Family of Officers, Strangers in a Queens Court. This was it which did oblige thoſe of <hi>Sparta,</hi> as <hi>Xenophon</hi> reporteth it, not to ſuffer any ſtrangers to live in their Commonwealth, which made the <hi>Athenians</hi> take the ſame reſolution, as <hi>Plutarch</hi> obſerveth in the life of <hi>Pericles,</hi> and which made <hi>Sue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonius</hi> commend <hi>Augustus,</hi> that he would rarely grant to any the being free or na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turals of his Kingdome, and which induced <hi>Polydore Virgil</hi> to ſay in his Hiſtory of <hi>England,</hi> That it was not the cuſtome of Engliſh to admit of many ſtrangers amongſt them, leaſt the difference of their cuſtomes and faſhions, might cauſe them, not to live in a good intelligence with the natives of the Country.</p>

                  <p>Amongſt divers others he was more particularly made choiſe of for that employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, becauſe there had been many of his near kindred retained near the Queen, who were now all ſent back again; So that it was thought conſidering the near Intereſt of his family, that he would be the more zealouſly affectionate, in diſpatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch inſtructions, as ſhould from time to time be ſent to him.

                     <hi>Montague,</hi> who was ſent into <hi>France</hi> upon the return of thoſe Officers; however he was no whit diſcouraged, at it, knowing that any Ambaſſador, ought to ſhut his eyes, at all little difficulties and obſtructions, ſo he may carry on his Maſters work to a good iſſue. The King of <hi>England</hi> appointed Commiſſioners to treat with him upon that affair, who being met together, he repreſented to them, in order to his inſtructions, that amongſt other things comprehended in the Articles of Marriage, it had been concluded and agreed on, That the Queen of <hi>England</hi> ſhould have free excerciſe of her Religion, that ſhe ſhould have a Biſhop and a certain number of Prieſts, to exerciſe the Offices of her Religion, That all her houſhold ſhould be Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiques and French, and that all the Engliſh Catholiques ſhould in general re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive greater priviledges, then had been granted them, if the Treaty with <hi>Spain</hi> had been effected: That the late King <hi>James,</hi> and the preſent King <hi>Charls</hi> his ſon then Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> had confirmed it by oath, and that King <hi>James</hi> had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded his Officers, not to trouble or moleſt the Catholiques any more, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon that the King his Maſter, had conceived great hopes of proſperity and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, for the Queen his Siſter, neither could he believe that the King of <hi>England</hi> his Brother in Law, would break his word given upon the conſideration of Royal Marriage, who until then had amongſt other virtues the reputation of being Juſt to his promiſes. That this new Alliance inſtead of reuniting their perſons and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts would now rather, breed great diviſions between them, and at ſuch a time, when they had moſt need of being in amity with one another, both for aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting of their Allyes, and their own particular preſervation. And that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all theſe premiſes, the King of <hi>England</hi> had ſent back all thoſe Officers, of the Queen, contrarie to the Treaty, which had been confirmed by oath; that he placed about her, Officers who were Engliſh, and of a Religion contrary to hers; and beſides all this that the Catholiques in General, were every where troubled and ill treated for their Religion ſake. So that the King his Maſter, unable to abandon the Queen his Siſters Intereſt, had ſent him to his Majeſty of Great <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi> to put him in mind of his promiſes, and to perſwade him. That her Majeſties Catholique Officers might be re-admitted to her, as alſo that his Catholique ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects might be more favourably dealt withal, The Engliſh Commiſſioners could not deny what had been concluded in the Treaty; but they would lay the fault of the Officers return, upon their own ſhoulders, pretending that they had raiſed troubles in the Kingdome, in his Majeſties own Family, and that of his dear con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort the Queen, but they did not produce any ſufficient proofs upon the buſineſs: And as to that which concerned the Engliſh Catholiques, they pleaded, that it had only been granted for formalities ſake, and to ſatisfie the Pope. But the Marſhal producing before them the late Kings Oaths, confirmed too by another of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent King, then Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> they could no longer tell what to ſay to the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but fled to other complaints, not material or any wayes relating to the matter in queſtion. The Marſhal replyed and that very tartly, that he could not ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly admire that the Articles of Marriage, and confirmed by Oath, were not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved: That the Queens Officers were ſent back, under pretence that they trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled the State, without giving the King his Maſter any notice of it, and without acquainting him in the leaſt with thoſe crimes which were preſented to be commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, That preſently thereupon, Engliſh Officers and thoſe Proteſtants, ſhould be placed in their rooms, That indeed thoſe accuſations were to be eſteemed as frivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, and admitting them for juſt, yet ought they to be chaſtiſed only, and others French and Catholique put into their places, by the rules of the Treaty. But that indeed thoſe pretended quarrels or Jarrs raiſed by the Queens French Officers, were ſo far from being the true cauſe of their return, that on the contrary, the Lord <hi>Mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

That of the ſuddain and unlookt for diſcharge of her Officers happening ſo immediately upon

                  <p>IT is very unſeemly that a Kings Officers ſhould perſwade him to be worſe then his word, onely to ſatisfie their own Paſſions. It were the ready way to ſubju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate the glory of the Maſter, to the Will of the ſervant, and to ſuffer the leaſt Stars to eclipſe the ſplendor of the Sun, who have no light; but what they borrow from his rayes. Private affections have ever been hurtfull to publick conſultations, as <hi>Titus Livy</hi> recordeth, neither was his judgement to be queſtioned, when he ſaid, there are cereain Clouds which do darken the Soul, and make it like a diſ-temper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed eye, which ſeeth all things far different from what they really are. The word of a Prince is a ſacred pledge, and his glory is linked with it. The Miniſter who is to ſee it performed, is obliged to effect it with inviolable reſpect, much leſſe, not to abuſe it for his own particular anger and Paſſion. How can it ſeem lawfull for a Miniſter to obſtruct it by ſo prophane an abuſe, when it is not permitted to a King himſelf to recede from it, though the good of his State were never ſo deeply con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in it. Good Princes, as <hi>Traian</hi> ſaith, are more bound to perform what they promiſe, then to effect what themſelves deſire, ſo that it is not permitted them in a Treaty to be worſe then their words, under pretence of the publick good; or to ſay their Counſel doth imagine the contrary to be more proper, or that the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of their affairs doth require it. If once a Prince ſhould do ſo he would ever paſſe for a Prince without Faith, which is the greateſt misfortune can betide them, and thus <hi>Mimus Publicanus</hi> ſaith, he who hath once forfeited his Faith, hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe to loſe, becauſe all the Goods and Honour of a man depend thereupon. It is indeed fit to conſider of Treaties with deliberation before they are entred into, but when once a Prince ſhall have paſſed his word to obſerve them, there cannot then be any ſtarting hole to creep out at. It is a ſhamefull excuſe for them to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge they did not think of it. <hi>Bias</hi> ſaith, they cannot make no lawfull excuſe, for he that loſeth the credit and glory of being eſteemed faithfull, hath a more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable damage, then if he loſt the thing which he promiſed. After <hi>Cinna</hi> had ſent for <hi>Marius,</hi> he made a queſtion whether or no he ſhould receive him; but <hi>Sertorius</hi> underſtanding he had ſent for him, told him it would be unfit to propoſe it to him; for (quoth he) the obligation of Faith, doth not allow of the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of what is once promiſed. But certainly it is a very great abuſe to the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty of a King to break his Oath, for by it he doth ſeem to mock God, whom he invoketh as a witneſſe of his promiſe. <hi>Cicero</hi> ſaith in his Offices, that an Oath ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ought to be broken, and the Egyptians puniſhed Perjury with death, becauſe they who were guilty of it, did not onely violate the worſhip of God, but broke faith which is the greateſt and ſtrongeſt tie of humane ſociety.</p>

                  <p>DUring all theſe civil and forraign broyls, the Cardinal was intent upon repai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring thoſe loſſes which <hi>France</hi> had ſuſtained in the late Wars, and upon ſetling ſuch an Order in the three States, that happineſſe might ſucceed their miſeries and abundance thoſe wants which they had undergone; in this, he imitated the wiſe Phyſitian, who having recovered his Patient, maketh it his work to reſtore his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ſtrength. There onely wanted this one thing to the compleating of it. That
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:56802:79"/>they upon whom the executing of his deſigns did depend, would lend their aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hands to it. Now Commerce at Sea, being one of the chief Fountains of a Nations riches, he made it his firſt care to ſettle that in a ſafe courſe, which his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty having aſſented to, he gave notice of it to the Undertakers, and that he ſhould be glad to ſee them enter into Companies and Partnerſhips; aſſuring them, that they ſhould have all poſſible aſſiſtance from him, and that he doubted not but they might in time, receive as great advantages by it, as the Hollanders did by that which is ſetled amongſt them, or as the Spaniards did from the Mines of <hi>Peru.</hi> There wanted not divers who were ready to adventure on ſuch a deſign, <hi>Montmor</hi> in the name of one hundred others, preſented to the Councel, Articles of eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment for a Company, to Traffique both into the Eaſt and Weſt, by Sea and Land. He proffered in their behalf to raiſe a ſtock of ſix hundred thouſand Livres, and that the moyety of the profits thereof, ſhould ſtil go towards the increaſing of the ſaid ſtock: That he would expend the ſum of ſix hundred thouſand Livres in building of ſhips and ſetling the ground-works of their Trade. Theſe Propoſals were very advantagious; his Majeſty approved of them, and commanded the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal to conclude upon the Articles with the Company. So they had divers Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges and Liberties granted to them, in regard of Forraign Wars, and the Wealth which followeth Traffique, as alſo in conſideration of the accruement of power and ſhipping by Sea, which was no ſlight matter, for that the Spaniards, Engliſh, and Hollanders had become very potent at Sea, by this means, and have often there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon fallen in upon our Coaſts at their own pleaſures. The Cardinal withall, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded his Majeſty, at the ſame time, to lay out a great ſum of money, to buy Ships both at <hi>Amſterdam, Denmark,</hi> and other places of <hi>France,</hi> to defend themſelves from the like incurſions.</p>

                  <p>IT was neceſſary upon ſetling the Company of Trade, to appoint them a head, who might have a full power amongſt them, and whoſe reputation and knowledge might countenance their undertakings, it being moſt certain, that ſuch deſigns as are out of the common road fall to nothing, if not upheld by ſome particular favour or an extraordinary underſtanding. To the Admirals care it could not be commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, unleſſe their ſpeedy ruine had been intended, for that he aſſumed of late ſo great a power over all Traders, that inſtead of aſſiſting, he undid them. The one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly difficulty was, that it being fit the head of this Company ſhould be abſolute, there would every day ariſe ſome diſputes between the Admiral and him; but the King to avoid this inconvenience, was of opinion, rather to ceaſe the Admiralty, then to break off the ſetling of Trade; for that the Admirals were no leſſe charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the State then to the Merchants, they drawing at leaſt one hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Livres out of the Treaſury every year, without any advantage by it. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the King reſolved about the beginning of the year, to take the Admiralty out of <hi>Montmorency</hi>'s hands, who ſeemed willing enough to part with it, by his readineſſe to treat thereupon, and in concluſion, he had a good round ſum paid him for it. This reſolution was of ſuch concernment, that without it, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Trading of <hi>France</hi> had been quite broke, but the Kings Subjects had been lyable to dayly Inroads and Pillagings, for that of late years, above four thouſand Chriſtians, had been been made Slaves by the Turks, above one hundred Veſſels taken, ſunk, and burned, by which means a great many families were brought to Beggery.</p>
                  <p>The King too good, juſt, and generous to ſuffer ſuch injuries, which by dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing his Peoples goods, did no leſſe take off from his reputation and glory, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to contrive ſome remedy for it. It was ordered that the Admiralty ſhould be ſuppreſſed, and that a chief, grand Maſter, and ſuper-intendent of Commerce of <hi>France</hi> ſhould be ſet up inſtead of it, endowing him with full power to execute the Office of Admiral, in ſuch caſes as might advantage the benefit of Trade, or the Kingdom, and cutting off all other power which might prejudice either of them. There was now onely wanting a perſon of quality to execute this charge who ought to be reſolute and clear from all private Intereſt, in regard of honour, or the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick good. The Cardinal had made it apparent that theſe qualifications are emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent in himſelf, ſo his Majeſty made choice of him, who accepted of it, but in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the Office, he would not take thoſe Allowances and Pays which had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly been due to the Admiralty, for that his Majeſty had ſuppreſſed that Office, partly to ſave the expence of it, ſo that inſtead of contracting any charge in this new Office, his Majeſty ſaved above one hundred thouſand Livres <hi>per annum,</hi> heretofore aſſigned to the Admiralty, beſides he had now the power of command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Fleets whereſoever he pleaſed, but before the command of them was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed to the Admirals, though they were not indued with qualifications neceſſary. for ſuch a charge, and which is moſt to be obſerved, that though the Cardinal might as eaſily have obtained the Office of Admiral, and executed it with the ſame advantage for the King, the benefit of <hi>France,</hi> and Trade, as that of ſuper-inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of the Sea, yet he waved that honour and contended himſelf with the means to ſerve him in a condition leſſe honourable, and leſſe ſubject to emulation.</p>

                  <p>IT is great diſcretion in a Miniſter to wave thoſe Titles, which onely ſerve by reaſon of their noiſe, to expoſe him unto Envy. They are but low Souls which affect ayry Titles, neither do they conſider how that by ambition they do provoke
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:56802:80"/>Fortune, and inſtead of making their authority reſpected, they do moſt commonly render themſelves ridiculous in the eyes of all wiſe men. Modeſty is the thing which makes greatneſs honoured, whereas oſtentation offending every one, atracts the hatred of all the World, and becomes inſupportable. Who ſo is advanced to any eminent pitch of Honour ought to imitate great Rivers, which glide a long, with little murmuring, though great profit to the people; whereas torrents being leſſe profitable do perpetually vex the head with their noiſe. Great men ought more eſpecially to ſhun ſuch titles of Honour, as may render them odious. <hi>Scipio Affricanus,</hi> a man who wanted neither courage nor diſcretion, gave us a notable example of this particular, as <hi>Titus Livy</hi> hath obſerved, when as the Spaniards called him King, and he refuſed that little, which he knew would be diſ-relliſhed by the Commonwealth, and told them that that of General of the Army was the greateſt Honour, he did aſpire to, That having indeed a royall ſoul he ſhould not much take it amiſſe if they thought him worthy of that Honour; but he beſeeched them to forbear the other, leaſt that might breed a jealouſie upon his Perſon.</p>
                  <p>Did not <hi>Auguſtus</hi> in the ſame manner teſtifie a great deal of Prudence, when in taking upon him the Emperial Crown, he refuſed to be called Emperours, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented himſelf with the name of Prince, which could not exaſperate the Roman people, it being a name in uſe amongſt them, and a faſhion to create a Prince of the Senate? his diſcretion told him, That the Romans would eaſilier undergo ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very it ſelf, then the name of it: and therefore he would prudently ſweeten the diſpleaſure which they might apprehend at their being brought under his command by a Title full of modeſty, He alſo aimed at the names of Conſul, Father of his Country, Tribune, and High Prieſts, only becauſe the people did not miſlike them, deſigning rather to add a new power to an old Title, then to aſſume upon himſelf ſuch odious qualifications as would only render his power feared and redoubted.</p>

When he had concluded, the Cadinal made a moſt excellent ſpeech, in which his eloquence was no leſſe to be admired at then his prudence. He laid before that
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:56802:80"/>Illuſtrious Aſſembly, how viſibly God had made uſe of his Majeſty to atchieve that in a little time for the publique good, which many thought impoſſible to have been effected in an age. He gave them to underſtand, that as there had been great charges and expences, ſo the King and Queen had received very great advantages by it, in relation to that Honour and Glory which is due to them; and that if any good ſucceſſe had at any time happened, it was only the dawning of thoſe reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which his Majeſty had taken, for the eaſing of his people, and reſtating the Kingdom in its former Splendor. That as only God can make ſomething out of nothing, ſo it was neceſſary to lay a good foundation in the Treaſury, and to that end, to cut off from the extravagant expenſes, and add to the receipts, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed to do both at once. He ſhewed them, how that every one, regarding the advancement of his own private Intereſt, it might poſſibly provoke ſome to anger, if their expences were moderated; but he added withal, that no one could juſtly complain at it, ſince nothing was to be preferred before the Publique good, and that the King and Queen Mother, were both reſolved to give a good example, by contracting the expences of their families.</p>
                  <p>He told them, that if in great tempeſts there was ſometimes a neceſſary to part with the goods, to eaſe the veſſel and defend her from ſhipwrack, prudence did direct the like thing in a State; Which ought not to be caſt away for the preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of any ones particular good, and that they themſelves were bound in reaſon to conform themſelves to the reſolution thereof, for that it is impoſſible private and particular mens plenty and Riches, ſhould long laſt, when the State is poor and needy, in fine, he told them, that ſetling a good government in the Affairs and Treaſuries, they would in a very few years find, both the King and Kingdom raiſed to a greater pitch of glory, then ever it had formerly been, but he added, it would not be ſo neceſſary to order ſuch things unleſſe they were really put in execution; That the glory of ſetling the Nation being reſerved for his Majeſty, they who were deputies ought to eſteem it a great Honour done them, in that he gave them part of it, and that for his own particular, he ſhould eſteem himſelf moſt happy to dye in the proſecution of ſo glorious a deſign.</p>
                  <p>After this firſt overture, the King ſent divers propoſals to the Aſſembly by his Solicitor General, upon all which ſuch courſes were reſolved, as were thought moſt neceſſary for the ſetlement of the State. But it was firſt of all concluded, what order ſhould be obſerved in the levying of men, as alſo for the maintaining of them, in ſuch order, that the Country man might not be injured by them. It was thought fit to keep two Armies in readineſs of between eighteen and twenty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand foot, and two thouſand Horſe, as well to ſecure the Publique Peace, as to ſupport the Kings Authority, and alſo to keep Forreigners in a due reſpect. It is true, there were ſufficient means found out to prevent the peoples damage, but it was to be doubted, that the Souldiers would not ſo readily obſerve thoſe commands which his Majeſty had been ſo careful to order. Next of all it was conſidered, what unneceſſary expences of the State ſhould be cut off, as well to pay off two and fifty Millions of Livers, which the Exchequer was indebt, as alſo to acquit the charges of the Nation without increaſing the taxes. In order to which it was thought fit to contract the expences of the King and Queens Families, according to the reſolution taken before the late Kings death: Not to exceed the ſum of two Millions in Penſions, which was the ſum appointed by the late King <hi>Henry</hi> the Great for that buſineſs, and laſtly the Aſſembly propoſed to his Majeſty, the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantelling of a great number of ſtrong places, which being in the heart of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, or at leaſt remote from the Frontiers, did only ſerve to countenance Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions, and conſume a vaſt ſum of mony for payment of the Garriſon Souldiers, and building unneceſſary Fortifications. There was alſo care taken, (with refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to his Majeſties good pleaſure) for the relief of divers poor Gentlemen, Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains and Souldiers, wounded in his Majeſties ſervice; And at laſt the Aſſembly made earneſt requeſt to his Majeſty, that he would for the future prevent, thoſe revolts of the Grandees, which were commonly made every year to the great trouble of
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:56802:81"/>the State, and that he would puniſh ſome for example ſake, who had the Bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, to take up Arms againſt his Authority, or to divide the State into Factions. They alſo propoſed to his Majeſty to admit into his Council, a certain number of Gentlemen, to bring them up to do him the more ſervice, by the knowledge which they might get in State affairs, and in concluſion, they gave his Majeſty moſt Prudent Counſel concerning the ordering and decreaſing of the taxes, for the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing of divers uſeleſs Officers, for the redemption of his Lands which were in Mortgage, by paying them in whoſe hands they were; the monies lent upon them, or full Intereſt, out of the account of the Revenue, to ſettle an order in the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury to prevent all future relapſes for the ſettlement of Commerce both by Sea and Land, for the diſtribution of charges as well millitary as others, which have dependance on the Chief Officers of the Crown, it being improper that they ſhould be beſtowed by any but the King himſelf. And theſe were the Chief things then brought into debate before them, and reſolved on. So their was a Paper drawn up of thoſe things which they propoſed to his Majeſty, the moſt part of which, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared ſo reaſonable and judicious, that they have ever ſince ſerved for <hi>Maximes</hi> and a Rule for the Goverment of the State; The Cardinal having put them in practiſe one after another, as faſt as ever the Civil warres, the Factions at Court, and the attempts of the houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> upon <hi>France</hi> and it's Allyes would give way for it.</p>

On ſuch an occaſion, divers have had recourſe to an Aſſembly of States: which becauſe they are ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily accompanied with confuſion by reaſon of the multitude, beſides the great expence which they draw on, I ſhould think it much more proper to make uſe of a ſelected Aſſembly, who are the only perſons, whoſe opinions ſerve for guides to the reſt, now no one can doubt but that their advices will be very neceſſary for a State on ſuch an occaſion, for that thoſe great perſons are like ſo many twinkling ſtarres, whoſe counſels are repleniſhed with ſo much light, that they ſoon make their Judgments of with is fit to be done, to ſhine forth. Not to need Counſel, is to be more then man, and not to make uſe of Counſel in affairs of concern, is to be leſſe then man. God is not contented only with overuling the Elementary World and to make it fruitful in all kind of Science, by the influences and light of the Sun, but he hath imparted ſome ſhare of his Luſter to the other ſtarres, and hath aſigned ſo conſiderable a proportion of work to them that every one reputeth them in part to be the univerſal cauſes of all ſublunary things; ſo it may ſafely be ſaid too, that God creating a Miniſter in a Kingdom, whoſe Souls he repleniſheth with any extraordinary part of underſtanding, doth not however forbear to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow ſome light upon others too, though peradventure inferiour both for ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency and quality, that they may contribute with him to the General good, by the particular knowledge which he may infuſe into them, and by the Counſels wherewith he may inſpire them. And if their advices may be of uſe in a Kingdom, they cannot be leſſe advantageous, unto a Miniſter, on ſuch an occaſion, in which the angring of divers perſons, cannot poſſibly be avoided. There never yet was any reformation for the publique good, but many particular private perſons were angred at it. They who Judg of all things by their own private Intereſt, are ever diſcontented, and conceive no little ill will, againſt that Miniſter who is guided only by his own will, and direction: Whereas if it were done by thoſe, whoſe wiſdom is eſteemed, and whoſe Prudence is reſpected, it would ſilence all men, and make that ſweet and eaſie, which elſe would be bitter and inſupportable. It is very dangerous it, for a Miniſter to undertake great enterpriſes upon, his own head only?
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:56802:81"/>For good ſucceſſe is not inherent in any man, ſeeing all are ſubject to Deficiencies in Actions and inconſtancy; withall it is not to be doubted, but that the greateſt part judging of things by the event, would charge him home with blame if any misfortune ſhould happen. How many great men who promiſed themſelves high matters, have ſeen the ſucceſſe fall contrary to their expectations, and have been expoſed to the diſgraces of their King and People for their ill ſucceſſe, which might have been ſecured too, had they but propoſed their deſigns, and taken good advice upon them in a Counſel of the moſt conſiderable Grandees in the State?

The wiſe man conſidereth that an indifferent favour is much more certain then thoſe great ones, and contenteth himſelf with what his Maſter beſtoweth; Fortune doth no ſooner raiſe him up but his diſcretion preſently tells him, that her ſmiles are incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, and that nothing can ſo much contribute to his preſervation, as to uſe them with moderation. He oftentimes reflecteth on that memorable paſſage of <hi>Soſiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> who being drawn in his Triumphant Chariot by four Kings, entertained him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with obſerving the motion of the Wheels, how that which was now uppermoſt preſently became loweſt, and being asked the reaſon of his contemplation, anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that he delighted to remark the turning of his Wheels, and was by it put in mind of the inconſtancy of humane Affairs, and that the ſame Fortune which had raiſed him to that height of proſperity above thoſe four Kings, then ſub-jugaged to him, might ſhortly bring him to the ſame condition. The wiſe Favourite fixing his mind upon the inconſtancy of Fortune, as upon a ſure maxime, never permitteth her to blind his mind with vanity, but keeps himſelf upon his Guard, not putting himſelf on in matters of State, but as his Maſter calls him, and payeth him the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter reſpects, as his obligations increaſe.

The Abbey of <hi>St. Vannes</hi> was ever reputed the moſt proper place of all the City for that purpoſe, whence it happened, that in the Charter of the ſaid Abbey, as was to be ſeen, there had been divers Articles concluded between the Biſhop of <hi>Verdun,</hi> to whom that place hath ever belonged, in which they bound themſelves to build their Church in ſome other place, if it ſhould be found neceſſary to make uſe of ſome part of it for the raiſing of a Cittadel.

                  <p>AMongſt the ſundry Priviledges, which our Kings beſtow on thoſe whom they call to their ſervice, one of the moſt juſt and ancient is, that they may not be Excommunicated by the Prelates for ſuch actions as they do in diſcharge of their duties. There need no other evidence of it but reaſon it ſelf, and the order eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed by God between the Spiritual and Temporal Power, which is ſuch, that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reſerving himſelf within his preſcribed bounds, ought not to attempt upon the others Power. And doth not Hiſtory furniſh us with divers examples, which are as ſo many proofs in this particular. I have ſeen an Act reſolved by an Aſſembly, ſelected in <hi>Normandy,</hi> dated the year twelve hundred and five, which containeth, that no Arch-Biſhop or Biſhop, may Excommunicate any Barons, Bayliffs or Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeants without his Majeſties permiſſion; and the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Roijen,</hi> thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on promiſed his Majeſty in the year twelve hundred and ſeventeen, not to excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate any of his Officers without his conſent. The Biſhop of <hi>Chartres</hi> in the year thirteen hundred ſixty nine, having attempted to Excommunicate the Kings Officers at <hi>Manto,</hi> was condemned by a Judgement to recall the Excommunicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or loſe his Temporal Goods which were taken into Cuſtody. The Official of <hi>Roijen</hi> in the ſame manner too, having thundred out an Excommunication againſt one of the Kings Bayliffs, in the year thirteen hundred and ſeventy, who refuſed to deliver a Clerk to him whom he had taken Priſoner in coloured cloaths, was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by a judgement of the ſame nature to take off his Excommunication. And was not a Cardinal Biſhop of <hi>Mans</hi> condemned by an Arreſt in the year one thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand four hundred ſixty and five, to abſolve thoſe Officers of his Majeſty, whom he had attempted to excommunicate with an inhibition, not to attempt the like any more hereafter. The Parliament of <hi>Grenoble,</hi> approving of the Cardinal <hi>de Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monts</hi> power, who was the Popes Legate in <hi>Avignon,</hi> in the year fifteen hundred and ſixteen, declared, That the Kings Officers who were in his juriſdiction, ſhould not be any ways liable to Eccleſiaſtical cenſures or interdictions. And when the

And of latter time. when the Cardinal <hi>de Sourdis,</hi> attempted to excommunicate certain Counſellours of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, <hi>Anno</hi> one thouſand ſix hundred and ſix, his Temporalties were ſeized on, and himſelf condemned by Arreſt of the ſaid Parliament to call in his Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication. It were eaſie to alledge many more like examples. But beſides (though there are proofs enough to convince that this priviledge doth really be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long unto the Kings Officers.)

                     <seg rend="decorInit">E</seg>VERY one verily beleeved, conſidering the Peace concluded with the Spaniards and Hugonots: That <hi>France</hi> which had a long while like a floating Veſſel been Weather beaten, would now caſt An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor in a quiet ſetled Harbour: It was every mans hope, now to injoy the fruits of ſo many labours, and that the Clouds paſſing away would make room for Serene Calms: But juſt as it was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to this Port, the Hugonots and moſt of the neighbour Princes, appeared on the ſhore to prevent its ſettlement on Land: They raiſed new ſtirs, they caſt up Shelves of ſand upon one another, and beat the Waves with ſuch violence and fury, that the end of one ſtorm was but the beginning of another, and that a greater then the former. Thoſe of <hi>Rochel</hi> having been of late accuſtomed to live in an inſolent licenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, could not indure to ſee the Articles of Peace which the King had accorded to them, put in execution; and Rebellion had taken ſo deep rooting in their minds, that the yoke of Obedience was become inſupportable to them; they could not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, that the Rules of Commerce, obſerved over all <hi>France,</hi> ſhould be taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of amongſt them. The cutting off of that abſolute authority which they had made uſe of, in the Iſles of <hi>Ree</hi> and <hi>Oleron,</hi> and other places bordering upon their City was looked on, as an outrage; the excerciſe of the Catholique Religion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſettled amongſt them, was eſteemed as a great ſlavery, and as a rigorous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint impoſed upon that whereof they made profeſſion. They complained of thoſe Souldiers in Fort <hi>Lewis,</hi> and the Iſles of <hi>Ree</hi> and <hi>Oleron,</hi> left there only to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent their relapſing into their former inſolencies, as a moſt inſufferable tyranny. They reſented his Majeſties Commiſſaries Acts in order to the execution of the Treaty, as ſo many unjuſt attempts upon their Liberties, and would needs have it be believed, that the continuation of Fort <hi>Lewis,</hi> was a breach of thoſe promiſes, which had been made to them. Theſe were the Chief complaints which they every where ſpred abroad; Theſe were the Griefs which filled their Manifeſts; Theſe were the Motives which they made uſe of to perſwade the reſt of the Hugonot Towns, to revolt, to form themſelves into a Commonwealth, and to obtain that by force from his Majeſty, which with Juſtice they could not expect: But theſe complaints were
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:56802:83"/>made with little reaſon for that ſubjects, cannot pretend any thing for their at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting on their Kings authority: and accordingly the anſwer which they could have, when they had the boldneſs to preſent them either to his Majeſty or his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter was, That being born ſubjects to his Majeſty, they neither ought or could pretend to any exemption from the Laws of obedience; That their complaints of violencies offered to their Religion, was groundleſs; for that they had a full li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of conſcience under his Majeſties protection and that all ſuch, as troubled them in it, were chaſtiſed as diſturbers, of the publique Peace: That true it was, by the Treaty of <hi>Monpellier,</hi> Fort <hi>Lewis</hi> ought to have been demolliſhed but with all, That they had made themſelves unworthy of it, by their refuſal, to execute ſeveral Articles of the Treaty, and amongſt others, to eſtabliſh, the excerciſe of the Catholique Religion, in their Citty as they had engaged to his Majeſty: and moreover, that the Honeſt's men of the Citty, the moſt ſufficient, and ſuch as had moſt to looſe, having repreſented to his Majeſty, that in caſe the Fort were ſligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, They ſhould be expoſed to the mercy of the Raſcality, who would put a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand outrages and affronts upon them, he could not deny their ſo juſt a requeſt: Beſides the ſixth Article of Peace granted them in February laſt year did expreſly ſay, that his Majeſty would not aſſent to the deſtroying of that Fort: They were alſo told, That being ſubjects of his Majeſty, they had no cauſe to complain, of the Commiſſaries being there, eſpecially ſeeing one of them too, was of their own Religion, and that they had not been then there, but for thoſe delayes which were by them made, in the execution of the Treaty: As to the quartering of Troops about their City and the adjacent Iſles, it was anſwered; That they had no reaſon at all to complain of it, for that they gave the occaſion, by their daily mutenies, by their ſlow proceedings in the demoliſhing of Fort <hi>Tadon,</hi> and which they did ſo ſlightly too, that it was an eaſie matter to repair it; and that laſt of all, thoſe Troops living very civilly, they enjoyed the ſelf ſame liberty which his Majeſties ſubjects did many other Town, where there was a gariſon and that they could not think it ſtrange, his Majeſty ſhould ſo watch them, who had ſo often revolted after ſeveral proteſtations of obedience to procure his pardon for their faults.

                  <p>JT is neither ſafe nor Juſt for a City, born under a Regal power, to ſhake off that obedience and become a Commonwealth. The injuſtice of them who ſhould attempt ſo to do cannot be defended, ſeeing Kings are the Lively Images of the God head, Livenants of his power, and that he hath ſubjected people in ſuch dependancies, that no one but himſelf alone, can revoke their Commiſſion. I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe thee, ſaith the Wiſeman, to have a care of the Kings mouth, and to keep the oath, that thou haſt ſworn unto him: beware that thou withdraw not thy ſelf from his power or ſlight his commands, for otherwiſe he will deal with thee as he li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth and no one can ſay unto him, What doeſt thou? And as this Procedure is very unjuſt, ſo it is not ſafe for them who would ingage in it, for that no Government is ſo bad as a Popular. There is indeed a certain kind of apparent liberty, which charmeth, and worketh upon the Souls of them, who do not under ſtand it, but it is moſt ſure, that it is a liberty which expoſeth a City, to the greateſt misfortunes, that can befall to it. All Kings propoſe Honour and the Publique good for the end of their Government knowing all their glory depends thereupon; whereas in a Popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar State, every one propoſeth his own particular advantage, and by that he mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſureth the Weal Publique, and then comes Honour in the very rear of all other thoughts. Wiſe diſcreet Counſels are ſo little eſteemed in Popular States, that they cannot remedie any inconvenience though accompanied with a very little difficulty. For though in State affairs moſt voyces ought to be conſidered; yet it
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:56802:84"/>is not to be thought in point of number, but the Prudence of them who Judge: whereas admitting the people to be Maſter, moſt voyces carrieth it clear from the reſt though better grounded, by far. The Senate of <hi>Rome</hi> choſe rather to allot Tribunes to the people, by whoſe mouths they might deliver their opinion, then to leave them in a Licentions power, concluding that though the Authority of thoſe Tribunes would be in ſome ſort ſuperlative, yet that it would be much more ſupportable, then that of the people, that many headed beaſt which having no Judgment, loveth change, and mooveth more by impetuoſity then reaſon. This Beaſt, nouriſheth it ſelf with a thouſand vain hopes, its deſigns are accompanied with fury, when the danger is fartheſt off; but ſoon looſeth his courage when brought upon peril; and as it hath but a ſmall portion of abilities, ſo it knoweth not who are men of underſtanding, or who do them good ſervice. Whence it doeth ordinarily well reward, ſuch as do them ill ſervice, and ill reward ſuch as do them good ſervice. Was it not heretofore ſeen that the <hi>Athenian</hi> baniſhed <hi>Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiades,</hi> ordered him to pay a great fine, and kept him in durance until he had paid it, as a reward for having with ten thouſand men ſaved their City from a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous ſiedge, and beaten one hundred and ten thouſand <hi>Perſians,</hi> by his good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct?

<pb n="157" facs="tcp:56802:84"/>do Courtiers follow the inclinations of Favorites. We have in the former year laid down the cauſes of his particular hatred, I ſhall now only add the reſentment which he took, at his Majeſties denial to let him come into <hi>France,</hi> was that, and only that which incenſed him to that height: But the Cardinal foreſeeing what effects, that refuſal would in reaſon produce adviſed his Majeſty to permit him to come to the Court, aſſuring him, that it would be eaſie to raiſe ſome advantages, out of that earneſt paſſion which he had to come thither, and that at laſt he could only end as <hi>Icarus</hi> did, who periſhed for aſpiring too high. Yet however the Queen Mother ſeconding the Kings reſolution for his non-admittance, ſhe became Miſtres of the Counſel, which ſo exaſperated <hi>Buckingham,</hi> that he vowed ſhortly to come into <hi>France</hi> ſo well attended, that they ſhould not be able to deny him entrance <hi>Madam de Cheureuſe,</hi> who was diſcontented too, and then in <hi>Lorrain,</hi> did not a little blow the Coales of his paſſion, and ſerve to nouriſh his anger; but as it would have been more to his diſcredit then Honour, to have openly declared it, ſo he wanted ſome pretences to cloak it. He pretended that the King of <hi>England</hi> his Maſter had been ſurety for the performance of thoſe promiſes which the King and his Miniſters had made to the Hugonots upon the concluſion of the Peace. Now the Chancellor having told their Deputies, in preſence of the Engliſh Ambaſſadours, that though the King could not be induced, to aſſent unto the demolition of Fort <hi>Lewis,</hi> yet that they might hope for it from his Bounty in Time, in caſe they lived within the bounds of a due obedience. Theſe hopes would he needs have paſſe for abſolute promiſes, and for Articles agreed on with Ambaſſadours, and in proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them, he would fain have it be believed that the King his Maſter, was bound, by way of caution to ſee the demolliſhing of it put in execution. He had likewiſe the boldneſs to let the King know from his Maſter of Great <hi>Britain,</hi> by his Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador, that he was likewiſe ingaged to ſee the performance, of a certain Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration made to the Hugonots by the Earle of <hi>Holland</hi> and the Lord <hi>Charlton;</hi> Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Ambaſſadours then at that Treaty, in which they had conſtrued the Chancellour <hi>Haligres</hi> words in that ſence, as was moſt agreeable to the Hugonots, and all, that they might ingage them the more unto their Intereſts, and not want a pretence to imbroyle things when ever they had a mind to it. But it was abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely denied, that the King of <hi>England</hi> did ever become engaged to ſee thoſe promiſes made to them of <hi>Rochel,</hi> performed, or that he had been treated with, or his Ambaſſadours, in any ſort whatever; But on the contrary, it was repreſented to them, how it was not forgotten, what meſſage his Majeſty then ſent to the Earle of <hi>Holland</hi> and the Lord <hi>Charleton,</hi> by the Duke of <hi>Cheureuſe</hi> and the Biſhop of <hi>Mande</hi> which was, that in caſe, they ſhould pretend to intermeddle in the Treaty, the King would not give his conſent to any thing, but if upon condition that the King of <hi>England</hi> would engage to aſſiſt him with a ſtrong Fleet to compel the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chelois,</hi> if they ſhould fall back from their duties. This had been told them once and again, and that plainly enough, as alſo confirmed by <hi>Monſieur</hi> the Cardinal, ſo that their pretences of the King of Great <hi>Britains,</hi> being Pledge for Performance of thoſe Articles granted to the <hi>Rochelois,</hi> were groundleſs: as alſo that frivolous pretext; of making uſe of the Earle of <hi>Hollands</hi> and the Lord <hi>Charle<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>KIngs when they have a mind to make a war, never want pretences to disguiſe the injuſtice of it; however it is an abſurd raſhneſs to ingage in any, without urgent neceſſity. I like well of <hi>T. Livius</hi> Judgment who ſaith war is then Juſt, when it is neceſſary; and that Arms are never attended with Juſtice, but when there are no other hopes but from them. And who can think otherwiſe of it, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing war is followed by all ſorts of miſeries? War it is which uſhers in diſorders, and evil cuſtomes, which taketh away the lives of the Innocent, which bringeth the Rich into want, and which generally baniſheth all the pleaſures of life to ſet up troubles and afflictions; So that a man can hardly fancy any thing more to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plored then war, from whence it followeth, that who ſo begins it, without abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute neceſſity, may be well compared to thoſe Chymiſts, who adminiſter ſuch po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to their patients, that they thence ſuffer more griefs and pains then from their ſickneſſes and diſeaſes. A wiſe man will abſtain from war, ſaith <hi>Xenophon,</hi> though he have ſome reaſon for it. <hi>Craeſus</hi> did ever prefer peace before war, if onely for this reaſon, becauſe in war Fathers did burie their Children againſt the Laws of Nature. The He Wolf is ſo ravenous according to <hi>Pliny,</hi> that having ſeized upon one Prey, and diſcovering another, he preſently leaveth his firſt and purſueth his ſecond game, though he be uncertain of taking it: He who would un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake a war without being abſolutely neceſſitated to it, doth not he do the ſame thing? doth he not hazard the pleaſures and certainties of Peace, to obtain victories by his Arms, which by the opinions of all Wiſe men, depend rather upon Fortune then Valour? He who deſigns anothers ruine, is himſelf often included in it, and that Prince who would blemiſh his Neighbours reputation, doeth often find his own expoſed to thoſe diſgraces which he had provided for others: He doth not only exhauſt his own Treaſures, but maketh himſelf hated by his ſubjects, in drawing from them contributions, for the carrying on of his war, in leading them to ſlaughter, and expoſing his Country to ruine; for that the divine Providence is well pleaſed to chaſtice arrogances and Publique in Juſtice, and raiſeth ſuch a flame as may deſtroy perchance his own Country, inſtead of his Neighbours. The flames of war are not ſo eaſily extinguiſhed as lighted, and many Grand Monarchs deſigning to employ them, for the ſubverſion of others, have only raiſed them, for the laſt piles of their own glory and Honours. It is no leſſe unjuſt to raiſe a war, not neceſſitated to it, then infamous to remain within dores, when the Publique Intereſts oblige the undertaking of it.</p>

                     </gap> Grand Miniſter who was eminently endued with thoſe two admirable qualities, openly told the King, (who chanced to diſcourſe with him upon that affair) that there was not any reaſon longer to put up their indignities, and that he thought it expedient for him to make uſe of his Arms, for the curbing in of the Inſolence of thoſe Rebels, who hourly diſturbed the Repoſe of his Country. He briefly repreſented to him, the ſeveral inſurrections which the Hugonots had of late years, raiſed up in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. That of all the Towns, <hi>Rochel</hi> was the ſupport, of their Revolts, as alſo the fierbrand, which Forrain Princes made uſe of to enflame the Kingdom with war, That that one City was an obſtacle to the undertaking of any great deſigns, That
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:56802:85"/>it was a ſhame to ſee thoſe Edicts how juſt or neceſſary ſoever, not regarded or obſerved in their City. That it ſerved for a Road to diſcontents, and a retreat for Rebels: That Peace could never be certainly eſtabliſhed, in the Kingdom nor abroad, whilſt that place was in a condition to ſecond a Faction: That <hi>France</hi> could not be in ſecurity from ſtrangers, whilſt that place was in its own power to ſet open their Gates: and on the contrarie, that there was reaſon to hope; for a happy and proſperous Peace, that place being once diſarmed and their Forts redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to nothing, by which they would be forced to live in their obedience. This diſcourſe once ended, it was no hard matter to reſolve his Majeſties inclinations, for the reducing them to the rules of obedience by a potent ſiege, eſpecially ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he was not of ſo little courage as to ſuffer ſuch obſtacles and indignities unpuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed any longer: But though it were regretful longer to ſuffer it, yet it was no leſſe, difficult to prevent it. The reaſon he had to puni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>h them, was apparently viſible, but the means how to do it, not eaſily found out; But as difficulties ſerve only to augment great courages, who are carried on by any extraordinary ſenſe of glory, ſo the King animated by the generous Counſels of the Cardinal, fixed upon the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of making ſtrong preparations for the ſiege of it.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall moreover ſay, That the Cardinal knowing that no one ought to ſhut his eyes in dangers, but rather to look upon them, exactly to conſider them, and if poſſibly apply preventive remedies to overcome them, ſo he did not diſguiſe any thing to the King which might happen in the ſiedg. He repreſented to them, the ſtrength of the Hugonot party, grounded upon many ſtrong places, fortified with intelligence from abroad, cemented by the Intereſts of divers Grandees of the Kingdom; and ſupported by their own Forces; that whatever the Precedent Kings had gained in many Battailes, and a long tract of various war, ſerved only to make Treaties of Peace, which are as ſo many marks, of their uncomptrouled inſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. He deſired him to remember the Ambition of Grandees, the Paſſion of Miniſters, the inſolencies of them of this Faction; their Plots, Cabal; and animoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and he clearly told him, That it was the more neceſſary to remove all theſe obſtacles, with his very utmoſt power, in regard if he did not, inſtead of healing it would feſter the wound, and diminiſh inſtead of making his Arms more conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable. But withal he aſſured him that in caſe his Majeſty, thought fit to do his utmoſt upon this rebellious place, there was reaſon to hope for a good ſucceſſe, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he had Peace with <hi>Germany</hi> and no enemy to divert him, the Engliſh only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, who at that time were not ſtrong enough to be much feared; That in caſe any one ſhould attempt upon <hi>France,</hi> there might however be means found out to put off or hinder their deſigns; which being ſo, he did not find any difficulties, but what were under his own power. That the Sea Port of this City might be block<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up, if he would go to the Charge of it, and that making a line about it with Forts and Redouts, all hopes either of men or victuals would be cut off from them. That bringing good ſtore of veſſels which might be drawn out from ſeveral ports of <hi>France,</hi> the Engliſh attempts in caſe their Fleet ſhould arrive, would be to no purpoſe ſeeing his Majeſties Ships would be all under the ſhelter of his Forts and Batteries, which might be raiſed at the mouth of the <hi>Channel;</hi> by which means <hi>Rochel</hi> would in a little while be reduced to neceſſity, forced to deliver upon mercy and then ſo ordered, that they ſhould never be in a condition, but of obeying for the Future.

                  <p>The Cardinal cauſed almoſt exact Plat-form of <hi>Rochel</hi> to be drawn out, and of all the adjacent places. He ſaw all their Forts, their Form height and bigneſs, the breadth and depth of their ditches, and whatever was ſtrong or weak in the whole
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:56802:86"/>Fortification. The wayes and paſſages of the whole Country were not omitted, nor the length and largneſs of the Channel, the places where Batteries might be raiſed, with Forts for defence of the Port, and oftentimes conſidering this Map with the Marſhal <hi>de Schomberg</hi> and other able Ingeniers for ſuch exploits, he framed ſo perfect an Idea of all that could happen in the ſiege fore-ſeeing effects in their cauſes, That he did no longer doubt of the victory; And having diſcourſed more at large with his Majeſty concerning it, he told him, that he could now al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt aſſure his Majeſty of a good ſucceſſe in this deſign, if it pleaſed God to Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſper it with his bleſſing, as there was great reaſon to hope, ſeeing he acted for the good of the Church, and the glory of his own name. The King was over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed at it, and from that time forwards preparations were made in all the adja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Provinces, of warlik amunitions, great ſtore of Cannon were ſent before hand towards the place that they might be in a readineſs when time ſhould ſerve; divers means were thought on, to block up the Channel, and to begin with thoſe of leſſe charge, to prevent greater expences, in caſe they might do the work; a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate computation was made of what horſe and foot, would be requiſite to inveſt the place, and ſecure the neighbouring Iſles, and to be ſhort, every thing was diſpoſed to the beſt advantage for the carrying on of the ſiedg.</p>

That Biſhops of what condition ſoever, being his Majeſties ſubjects, owe as much reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect and obedience to him, as others of his degree, that when they fall off from their duties, it is then the more juſt to puniſh their faults, their Delinquency be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an ill example, to which moſt people are apt to follow: That injoying their Temporal States onely in order to the Oath of Allegiance, which they all ſwear to his Majeſty, they do moſt eſpecially deſerve to be deprived of them, when they break their ſaid oath; That his Majeſty was more eſpecially obſigned to maintain his Right in <hi>Verdun,</hi> which was a Fontier Town, and in regard too, that the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop had attempted againſt his Royal Authority in hindring the building of the Cittadel, though it were a thing only relating to the Soverainty, and in which he was not all concerned: Theſe anſwers were ſo Juſt and grounded upon ſuch ſollid reaſons, that nothing could be replied againſt them, ſo the Duke had recourſe, to his entreaties and beſeeched his Majeſty for his ſake, to wink at with was paſt, to order reſtitution of his ſeizures, and to command the Biſhop Officers to be re-eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed in their former charges. He was very urgent in his behalf, and becauſe at the ſame time the Emperour having writ to his Majeſty in his favour, the King had returned him anſwer, That at his deſire, he ſhould willingly grant him any reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable favour, the Duke obtained his requeſt but upon condition however, That the Biſhop ſhould firſt ſend a Commiſſion to one of his Vicars, to revoke the Cenſures which had been given out againſt his Majeſties Officers, and them who worked on the Cittadel, and that in fature he ſhould comport himſelf with more reſpect and moderation. The Duke did willingly become bound for his perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance, and having ſent the Commiſſion the King diſcharged the ſeizures and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led all things in their former ſtate. But notwithſtanding all the Duks ſeeming affection &amp; forwardneſs in this affair, yet that was not the chief end of his Journey. He had been newly put into poſſeſſion of the States of <hi>Lorrain</hi> and <hi>Bar,</hi> by vertue of <hi>Reynard</hi> the ſecond King of <hi>Sicilies</hi> will, and by the reſignment of his Father, the Count of <hi>Vaudmont</hi> pretending to hold them of his Liege in his own proper name, though the late Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> his Predeceſſor had, and that with reaſon declared, by giving him his eldeſt Daughter to wife, that ſhe ſhould be the true Inheretrix of his States, and that he ſhould only enjoy them in her right.</p>
                  <p>He alſo made his entry into <hi>Nancy,</hi> with Balls and publique rejoycings in his Court, and all that he might celebrate with the more Honour his arrival to the Crown of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> hereupon he pretended to do Homage to the King in his own name, for the Dutche of <hi>Bar,</hi> as appertaining to him in Fee, and not in right of his wife, but he therein met with greater obſtacles then in that of the Biſhop of <hi>Verdun.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It was preſently given him to underſtand, that he had not a little offended his Majeſty, in that he had upon his own head aſſumed upon himſelf the Inveſtiture of <hi>Bar,</hi> and not expected his Majeſties introduction, to whom the Soverainty did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long. That he had expedited all letters Patents in his own name, without men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning that of the Dutcheſs his wife, for that no vaſſal hath any thing by deſcent in his Fee, until he be inveſted by his Soverain to whom he doth Homage; That he gave a juſt ground to be diſſeiſed of it, if he ſhould poſſeſſe himſelf thereof, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he were lawfully introduced; That he had alſo committed no ſmall fault when as he attempted to alter the quality of Tenure of <hi>Bar,</hi> and ſo create it Maſculine, whereas the Chief Soveraign could only alter the nature of Fees, and diſpence with Cuſtomes.

To ſpeak ingeniouſly, ſuch Laws are the Pillars which uphold Authority, and as a building, if the Foundation be undermined and ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, ſoon falls to the earth; ſo a State too quickly comes to ruine, if thoſe Laws upon which it is eſtabliſhed once come to deſtruction or alteration. For this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, <hi>Adrian</hi> ordained that no one ſhould intraduce any new Cuſtomes into <hi>Rome. Plato</hi> in his Common-wealth, prohibiteth the changing of any thing in it, even Childrens-play; for novelties alter manners, and bring antiquity into diſ-eſteem, a thing of great conſequence. I ſhould like well of the alteration of ſome rules of Juſtice, becauſe the manners of men are variable, and the puniſhing of Crimes too may admit of change, according to the diſpoſition of men and times. But it is not the ſame thing in fundamentals, which rule the government, and which ſettle the election which God hath made of a Soveraign, which do authorize the order eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed by former Princes, for the ordering of the people, and which are the known rules for the preſervation of the common good; indeed ſuch ought no more to be

                  <p>THE King was much troubled ſoon after the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi>'s departure for the Dutcheſs of <hi>Orleans</hi> his Siſter in Law. We have in the former yeart related, how many broils the marrying of this Princeſs did raiſe at Court, and how moſt of the Princes of Chriſtendome indeavoured to hinder it, now we are come to won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at the blindneſſe of Grandees, who turmoil themſelves in extremity, who move heaven and earth by their broils, and all for thoſe things, which death, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtancy of humane affairs cauſe to vaniſh in a moment. The marriage was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded but more for diſcretion than love in his part, yet God ſo bleſſed it, that Love had quickly united both their affections very ſtrongly; notwithſtanding all the indeavours or devices of <hi>Monſieurs</hi> Favourites and Creatures, to make him diſ-eſteem her, and her not to love him; the particular merit of this Princeſs gave great reaſon to beleeve, that <hi>Monſieur</hi> could come to be ſenſible of it, and would by his eſteem and affection give her a great power over his Soul: Now his Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites finding if things went in that way, it would be a great prejudice to their affairs, and leſſen the power which they pretended to have in his houſe, left no ſtone un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned, that they might ingage his affections elſewhere, at leaſt leſſen his kindneſs to the Princeſſe; but <hi>Monſieurs</hi> good nature animated by the vertue of this Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe, was above the malice of thoſe Factious Intereſts: So that love having joined their wills in a true affection, death could not ſeparate them, but to their great griefs. The Princeſſe growing big in a few moneths after her marriage, was about the end of <hi>May</hi> brought to bed of a daughter, but ſo mis-fortunately that there was little hopes of ſaving her life. <hi>Monſieur</hi> was every hour with her, ſo that it could not be concealed from him, and he unable to diſſemble the greatneſſe of his affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſhe was forced to comfort him, by teſtifying her readineſſe to ſubmit to what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever God ſhould c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

In the interim, the Phyſitians imployed their utmoſt Art but to little purpoſe, ſo that after ſhe had diſpoſed her ſelf to leave this world, by all religious actions which might make her fit for heaven, ſhe died and by her death taught all great men, that in greatneſſe nothing is more certain then inconſtancy, and that greatneſſe ought to be conſidered onely as a game of Fortune, which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a fair flouriſh, bring all to nothing in a moment.

                  <p>HE ſpoke very wiſely concerning worldly greatneſſes, who ſaid they are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained with much peril, kept with no leſſe vexation and inconſtancy; and loſt with as great priſe; What ever luſter and dazeling the Sun makes in our eyes yet we ſee him ſet everyday, and though men attain to never ſo great glory, yet muſt they be laid in the duſt. The ſame cauſe which gives us life, leads us on to death, yet as the ſame Sun which uſhers in the morning light leaveth us in darkneſs at his departure. The ſame Sun going out of the firſt degree <hi>Aries,</hi> reſteth not until his return; and we too, once borne, are hurried on to death. Nothing is here beneath more certain then incertainty, more conſtant then inconſtancy. Though Fortune be ſo favourable as to let us enjoy greatneſs ſome little time, yet then comes death and ſnatcheth all away, forcing us to pay that duty which we own, what ever reſiſtance we make againſt its aſſaults, it will at laſt force us to ſtoop
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:56802:88"/>under its Laws; its dart is unavoydable, ſo that there can be no greater wiſedom then to reſolve of being overcome, and to enjoy that without regret which For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune prepareth for us. In our expectation of deaths comming to deprive us of all we ought to attend it, with the greater care in regard the Limites of man's life are ſo uncertain, and when it comes, we ought not to think it hath made too much haſt, ſince no death is precipitated upon us: and conſidering the uncertainty of the time, when it will come, we ought however to be aſſured, that one day it will come, and carry us out of this World. Let the World flatter it ſelf with all it's glories, yet death will cut all down: After the earth hath been enameld with Flowers, repleniſhed with a thouſand ſweets, arrayed with infinite plants, and laden with rich Harveſts, yet a few months, and her beauty withers, ſhe becomes covered with ſnows, hayles and ſtorms, ſhe is glued up with froſts and drowned in raines. So ſhall the greateſt Princes find their luſter and glory terminated by death in the grave. Their Splender ſhall fade like Flowers, their proſperities melt like ſnow, and though like Torrents they have aſtoniſhed the world by their noiſe, at laſt they ſhall paſſe away like a flaſh of lightning.</p>

                  <head>A Duel between the Marquis <hi>de Praſlin,</hi> and the Sieur <hi>de Bouteville</hi> ſeverely puniſhed.</head>
                  <p>THough the King had made ſo ſtrict an Edict againſt Duels, yet ſuch was the blind fury which had ſeized on the ſouls of the Nobility, that ſome of them could not refrain fighting. This Errour which had built glory upon Revenge, and cauſed Duels to paſſe for a teſte of courage, had taken ſuch deep roots in moſt of their thoughts, that it was impoſſible totally to extirpate it: and as heretofore among the <hi>Macedonians,</hi> he was accounted an unworthy fellow, who had not ſlain ſome of his Countries enemies, ſo in <hi>France,</hi> he who had not killed one or more in Duelling, could not be thought valiant. The King had made rigorous Edicts againſt this lamentable evil, which had untimely raviſhed a number of Brave men out of <hi>France,</hi> ſince <hi>Henry</hi> the ſecond's time. But as it is to ſmall purpoſe to make laws unleſſe they who violate them, be puniſhed accordingly, ſo his Majeſty was very ſtrict in chaſtiſing thoſe Gentlemen which ſhould offend in that particular: The Marquis <hi>de Praſlin,</hi> ſon to the late Marſhal, had the boldneſs to fight with the Baron <hi>du Bar;</hi> for his puniſhment he was deprived of his Livetenant Generals place in Champagne, and forced to live ſome years away from the Court. About the ſame time there was ſome ſuſpition upon the <hi>Sieur de Liancourt,</hi> for having challenged the <hi>Sieur de Creſſia</hi> from the <hi>Duc d' Alvin,</hi> and though there were only conjectures of it, yet the King forbid them the Court: and alſo reſolved to diſpoſe of the place of firſt Gentleman of his Bedchamber, which belonged to the <hi>Sieur de Lian Court,</hi> and had accordingly done it, but that ſome perſons of quality, who ſerved them in that affair teſtified that there had not any challenge paſt in it. This was ſo exemplary a puniſhment that every one began to hope, the Nobility would at length, be undeceived, of that belief which they had, that the Laws of Honour were contrary to thoſe of vertue and Chriſtianity. But raſhneſs hath no bounds, The <hi>Sieurs de Bouteville</hi> and <hi>des Chapelles</hi> carried themſelves to ſuch exceſſe, that his Majeſty was forced to make uſe of his Juſtice to puniſh them, with more then ordinary ſeverity, being unable to pardon them, without giving way and counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancing the neglects of his Crown, and a madneſs which cryed for Juſtice from Heaven and Earth.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Sieur de Bouteville</hi> was indeed to be commended for his good courage, as his very enemies would confeſſe, but it not being guided with diſcretion, it depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved into ſuch a fury, that there was hardly any one at Court reputed for a ſtout man, but he muſt needs meet him with his Sword in his hand; Not a day how holy ſoever, but he would profane by his Duels, no place how publique ſoever which he would not bath with the blood of ſome one or other, ſo little reckoning did
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:56802:88"/>he make of the Kings Prohibition; after the comming out of the Edict, he had fought with the Count <hi>de Thorigny</hi> and ſlain him: about the end of the foregoing year, and the begining of this he had another Duel with <hi>la Frete,</hi> where his ſecond was killed, which quarrels of his were ſo much the leſs to be connived at, in regard thoſe of the beſt quality were ſtill parties in it. So the King reſolved to puniſh him, which he having notice of withdrew himſelf into <hi>Flanders,</hi> where he found means to perſwade the Archducheſs to Intereſt her ſelf in his affairs upon the ſcore of the <hi>Damoizelle de Montmorency</hi> her favorite, who writ to his Majeſty to beg his pardon, The King took advice of his Confeſſor, and as there was no reaſon to forgive ſuch offences, ſo he counſelled him not to grant it, and made it evident to him, that he could not do it, with a ſafe conſcience; but that his Majeſty might not ſeem totally to deny the <hi>Infante,</hi> he ſent her word that at her requeſt he ſhould not be queſtioned for what was paſt, provided he came not either to <hi>Paris</hi> or the Court. This was as much as a Juſt Mercy could well do; But the ſame fury which had formerly ingaged <hi>Bouteville</hi> in thoſe quarrels, did ſo provoke him upon his Majeſties denial of a total pardon, that he openly vowed he would ere long fight in <hi>Paris,</hi> nay, and in the Place Royal it ſelf; accordingly not long after thither he came, and having given notice of it to the Marquis <hi>de Beuuron,</hi> with whom he had a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel, that he was ready to give him ſatisfaction for thoſe differences between them, which he had not the liberty to do in <hi>Flanders,</hi> whither <hi>Beuuron</hi> had come to find him out, by reaſon of the promiſe which he had ingaged to the <hi>Infante,</hi> not to fight on any of her Territories: So they made choiſe of the Place Royal for their combats, where being met three againſt three, <hi>Bouteville, des Chapelles</hi> and <hi>La Berte,</hi> againſt <hi>Beuvron Buſſi, d' Amboyſe</hi> and <hi>Bouquet,</hi> they fought and <hi>Beuvron</hi> was killed out right, by <hi>Chapelles, La Barte</hi> deſperately wounded by <hi>Bouquet,</hi> and <hi>Bouteville</hi> with <hi>Beruuron</hi> cloſe grapling together, with a good will to be at it with their daggers, but having caſt away their Swords, it is reported how in this equality of advantage they mutually asked one anothers life, to go part their friends. This was all that could be got from their neglecting the Kings will, and the fury which led them to entertain ſuch deteſtiable offences. The King heard of it, and ſoon after that, <hi>Buſſy's</hi> Mother had arreſted <hi>Bouteville,</hi> by a Gentleman of hers, and <hi>des Chapelles at Vitry,</hi> from whence they were conducted to ſafe Cuſtodie to <hi>Paris</hi> and there de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered over to the Parliament, to be proceeded againſt, his Majeſty having abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely refuſed to ſhew them any favour, though their kindred made great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts for it, and at laſt their heads were ſtruck off at the <hi>Greve,</hi> by order of the Parliament.</p>

                  <p>HE who defendeth the wicked, and he who offendeth the good, are both in equal abomination before the Lord, as <hi>Salomon</hi> ſaith in his Proverb's, I ſhould therefore ſubmit to that of St.<hi>Chriſoſtome</hi> who ſaith, That as Juſtice without Mercy is not Juſtice, but cruelty: So Mercy without Juſtice, is not Mercy but extream raſhneſs. It were not leſſe improper, to pardon all Crimes, then to uſe on all occaſions the extremity of Juſtice. Both ought to be moderated by diſcretion, without which there are as many inconveniences which will follow gentleneſs as ſeverity. <hi>Philip</hi> adviſed his ſon <hi>Alexander</hi> to be very courteous to his ſubjects, whilſt he was not King, for it would not be fit for him to uſe ſo great indulgence towards them, when as he ſhould arrive to the Throne; Judging, with great wiſdome, that it is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for him who ruleth, to treat all with clemency; not only becauſe the Intereſt of his ſubjects doth ſometimes compel him to be ſevere, but alſo becauſe unleſſe he puniſh the wicked, it will be a dimination of his own authority: The <hi>Heathens</hi> ſay, <hi>Jupiter</hi> himſelf cannot raign without Juſtice. And <hi>Plutarch</hi> in the Life of <hi>Demetrius</hi> ſaith, nothing is more becoming a Prince, then the excerciſe of this vertue; and doth not <hi>Solomon</hi> who is much more authentique, ſay, The Throne of a King is eſtabliſhed by Juſtice. St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> in his Tract of the twelve abuſes,
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:56802:89"/>ſaith the Juſtice of the King, is the Peace of the people, the Nurſe of Children, the defence of the Country, the comfort of the poor, and himſelf the hope of Heaven to come. And if a Soveraign ever may make uſe of it, he ought not to let it lye idle, when it ſends to the purging of his Court from ſuch ſeditious companions, as engage his nobles daily to cut one anothers throats.</p>
                  <p>It is a Crime more then <hi>Brutal;</hi> for the inſtinct of nature, forbideth beaſts to fall upon one another. It is reported that <hi>Neurians</hi> are Wolves one ſix mouths of the year, &amp; men t'other ſix mouths, but I ſhould with more Juſtice imagine their ſwaſh bucklers, not to be men at all, but that by their greedineſs of ſpilling mans blood, that are beaſts Wolves and Tigres, all their lives. Their courage is not courage but a fury, which hurrieth them on to dip their hands in their brothers blood, not a courage but a Rage which maketh them madly expoſe their bodies to death, and their ſouls to damnation. It is not any juſt Law of Arms which obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth that to be thus barbarous, but a Deviliſh Charm which deprives them, of their reaſon. The fooliſh paſſion of an imaginary honour which animateth them, is a monſter begot by vanity, brought up by fury and nouriſhed by blood; as it is ſaid of that in <hi>Habacuc,</hi> the greateſt, the nobleſt and moſt courageous ſerve it for a prey. What apparency of reaſon can there be alledged, for renuing the old Butchery of <hi>Haman</hi> fleſh, before the images, not of a <hi>Moloc;</hi> a <hi>Saturn,</hi> but a vain fantaſie of honour? What Juſtice to tollerate that, which God hath ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly forbid and condemned to be puniſhed with death, which heaven abhors, which the Laws deteſt and which is only worthy of Hell fier? But above all things, it ought not to be permitted, when committed in dirſion of the Regal authority, for once admitting a Kings power to be trampled on, the next thing which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, will be the peoples revolt, and a general confuſion in the whole Kingdom.</p>

He had at that time his Arms in his hand to ſecond the Engliſh and Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> and at the ſame time that he ſend to the Queen Mother he reſolved to beſiedg <hi>Coffie,</hi> where <hi>Mountagu</hi> was then Priſoner, as alſo to aſſault divers other Frontier Towns, whilſt his Majeſty was buſied in reſiſting the Engliſh: But the dilligence uſed in removing of <hi>Mountagu</hi> from <hi>Coiffie</hi> to <hi>Paris,</hi> together with the defeat given the Engliſh at <hi>Ree,</hi> as ſhall anon be declared, made him and the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> too, change their reſolutions for that they found the King in a condition able to deal with both of them at once.</p>
                  <p>They were likewiſe told that in caſe they would oblige his Majeſty to come out of <hi>Poictou,</hi> they might both of them pay the charges of his Journey: So the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> turned his deſign upon <hi>Genoua,</hi> which he thought to ſurpriſe, by a Stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugem which had been contrived, and the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> was contented to be quiet upon aſſurance given him, that <hi>Mountagu</hi> ſhould be ſet at liberty, ſoon after his Majeſties return to <hi>Paris.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>His anger was like ſtorms which after much noiſe, are quelled in a moment ſhe reſolved without any great intreaty, to expect the Kings return to <hi>Paris,</hi> whither he ſoon after arrived: <hi>Mountaigu's</hi> Perſon not being ſo conſiderable as his Papers, from which there had been diſcovered as much as was deſired, his Majeſty brought him out of the Baſtile and delivered him up unto him reſerving that puniſhment for another time which he had reſolved for the Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> and which he had deſerved by his engaging in ſuch intreagues. In the mean time the King was very glad to ſee in theſe Papers, that the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> knew of the Engliſh deſign to land in <hi>Ree,</hi> that he had promiſed to aſſiſt them; That he had perſwade the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> to revolt; that he had aſſiſted him with ſuccours; That he had ingaged to fall upon the <hi>Dauphine</hi> with ſix thouſand foot, and twelve hundred Horſe. There was by them likewiſe diſcovered the deſign which the Engliſh had projected againſt <hi>Toulon,</hi> for the ſending certain Ships pretending to trade in the <hi>Levant,</hi> and how the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> engaged to aſſiſt them with men and Gallies; That the ſame Duke had a hand too in that attempt which was afterwards made againſt <hi>Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelier;</hi> That he had intended to have ſurpriſed <hi>Brecon</hi> and <hi>Valence,</hi> and beſides all

                  <p>TO be imployed without good cauſe for the troubling of a Forrain Princes State, is a Commiſſion, as little happy as honourable. If it tend to the Arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his ſubjects againſt him, It hath ever had ſuch ill ſucceſſe, that one may ſay of him who arms them, that in ſhaking the Pillars of the State, Juſtice, and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, he only burries them in their own ruines. If it be for the making of confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deracies with neighbouring Princes to make a war upon another, they laſt ſo little, that there is not any hopes of more expectation from them: Either of the Chiefs would have more power in the Army then his companion. Then comes diſtruct between them, no one obtains any glory, which t'other doth not envy, nay and hinder too if he can; Great deſigns raiſed upon ſuch weak grounds fall to ruine, like ſtructures built upon a foundation of ſand. War is of it ſelf ſo uncertain, that he who begins it, is not ſure to gain any thing by it. A Command miſ-appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended, an Order ill executed, an enterpriſe not well timed, an inconſiderate raſhneſs, and in ſhort one poor ſingle word may ſometimes put a whole Army to the rout; Beſides negotiations being often conſidered, by their Events, all the blame will be aſſuredly laid in his diſh, who firſt perſwaded to the deſign. On the other ſide, God favoureth Juſt Arms, and vallour ſignifies nothing ſaith <hi>B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>But to waht dangers doth he expoſe himſelf whilſt he paſſeth thorough his States, againſt whom he attempteth to make a war? Not to ſtop him, were a madneſs in any Prince, and a greater, not to puniſh him for his raſhneſs. But ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit he eſcape that mis-fortune, his very Commiſſion is contemptible ſeeing it uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally brings trouble and charge to his Country. I have ever much eſteemed of <hi>Phocions</hi> words in <hi>Plutarch,</hi> to <hi>Leoſthenes,</hi> who in an Oration endeavoured to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage the <hi>Ethenians</hi> in the <hi>Lamian</hi> war after <hi>Alexanders</hi> death; Thy ſpeech quoth he is like a Cypres large and full, but beareth no fruit, for juſt thus thou makeſt the people conceive victories and thy words puff them up with ſignal advantages, but indeed there is not any juſt ground to hope for any certain fruit, from ſuch a war tending to the States good, ſo inconſtant misfortunate and expenſive are all wars whatever. What did all thoſe turbulent Souls carry away but blame and misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, who employed their whole time, provoked to it, only by their particular paſſions any unjuſt reaſons, to raiſe wars amongſt Princes. The Count de St. <hi>Paul</hi> may ſerve for a notable example in this kinde. After he had ſpent all his dayes in Broyles and turmoyles, his glory vaniſhed like ſmoak, and at laſt he payd for thoſe Treacheries by death which he had put upon <hi>Lewis</hi> the Eleventh. In the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner <hi>Savanorolla</hi> had paſſed for a Saint amongſt the Florentines, but for that ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Spirit, which animated him againſt the houſe of <hi>Medicis,</hi> and excited him to make a war even againſt his own Cittizens; but the blame he reaped by it, ſullyed all his glory, and in my opinion whoever engageth himſelf in ſuch a Commiſſion may not expect any greater honour by it.</p>

                  <p>THeſe Forrain deſigns were not a lone to be feared, there were divers other Grandees of the Kingdom ſediouſly diſpoſed who had ſome notice of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended ſiege of <hi>Rochel,</hi> The Major part of them foreſaw that in caſe <hi>Rochelle,</hi> were taken, they muſt then of neceſſity live in an exact obedience, That it would carry with it an abſolute ruine to all the Hugonot party; and that there would be no more means left them to riſe up againſt the Kings authority in future, when they had a mind to procure any thing by force: neither were they a little ſtartled at the
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:56802:91"/>aſſurance of the deſign his Majeſty had reſolutely taken, of carrying the place. The Grandees have alwayes thought the encreaſe of the Royal Power, a diminution to their own private authorities, and they of <hi>France</hi> were not ignorant, that in caſe the Hugonot party were deſtroyed, they had then no game left to play but that of ſubmiſſion. This induced ſome of the moſt factious to caſt out ſuch diſcourſes, as could only be deemed the Symptoms of a Revolt, though as yet there had not been any apparence of a formal contrived deſign. The King had learn't from ſome of the old Court, that that which hindred the taking od <hi>Rochel,</hi> when as <hi>Charles</hi> the ninth beſieged it, was only, the little inclination which many of the Grandees then at the ſiege had, that it ſhould be taken as the Marſhal <hi>de Montlue</hi> teſtified on the place by divers letters: So that he reſolved to prevent this inconveniency; neither was it leſſe needful to prevent the growing of this cabal, leaſt they ſhould by joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves with the Hugonots and ſtrangers force his Majeſty to draw off his Armies and to attend their motions. The wiſe and diſcreet reſolution which his Majeſtie took, to give an aſſured remedie hereunto, was, to clap up in the <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtille</hi> ſeveral ſedicious turbulent perſons, who began to ſpeak aloud ſuch things, as neither the Laws of obedience or reſpect could allow of, but with order that they ſhould be well treated and want nothing, it being his Majeſties deſire only to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent them from doing any hurt. The Marquis <hi>de Rouillat de Bounivet, de Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinſon &amp; d' Oy,</hi> were firſt of all ſecured, and ſhortly after <hi>Fancan</hi> and <hi>La Mille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiere,</hi> with other inferiours to keep them Company, which made them perceive, who had the good Fortune not to be interreſſed in any of theſe Broyles; that the King was no more to be dallyed with and that it would become them to live with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in their limits, and that they could not avoyd lodging in the ſame place, if they gave any cauſe of ſuſpition by their behaviour: Thus every one for love or fear was quiet, and the King had the freedome to continue his preparations for the ſiege of <hi>Rochelle.</hi>

                  <head>Differences between the Duke of <hi>Eſpernon</hi> and the Parliament of <hi>Bourde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aux,</hi> reconciled by the diſcreet fore-ſight of the Cardinal.</head>
                  <p>THere was about the ſame time, ground enough to ſuſpect leſt the bitterneſſe which had about a year ſince diſunited the Duke of <hi>Eſpernon,</hi> Governour of <hi>Guyenne,</hi> and the Parliament of <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> might prejudice his Majeſties ſervice in this juncture, where it was needfull that all his Arms and Juſtice might concen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to ſtifle rebellion in its birth, and to keep the people in their duty. <hi>Monſieur</hi> the Cardinal ſpake to his Majeſty, and perſwaded him to ſend the <hi>Sieur de Leon</hi> Councellour of State to <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> to indeavour their reconcilement, and ſuch a correſpondency as might befit his Majeſties affairs. The ground of their difference was this, the Duke of <hi>Eſpernon</hi> had cauſed the Edict of Peace, granted by the King to the Hugonots, to be proclaimed by the Jurats of the City before it had been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtred in the Parliament. Whereupon the Parliament had turned one <hi>Minuelle</hi> out of his Office of chief Jurat, fining him 1500 Liures, and ordered the reſt to appear in Court, and ſuffer ſuch puniſhments as ſhould be impoſed upon them. The Duke of <hi>Eſpernon</hi> would not put up the buſineſſe, but puliſhed an Ordinance to prohibit the execution of the Parliaments Arreſt, and confirmed <hi>Minuelle</hi> in his Office, grounding himſelf upon certain pretenſions in publication of Treaties of Peace. The Parliament hereupon condemned the ſaid Ordinance as an attempt contrary to the Kings Authority intruſted with him; but the Duke of <hi>Eſpernon</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not of an humour eaſily to ſubmit to any others will, then that of the Kings, perſiſted to prohibit by another Ordinance the execution of the ſecond Arreſt. The Parliament made a third; ſo did he too to hinder <hi>Minuelle</hi>'s diſplacing, and that the Jurats ſhould not aſſiſt at the publication of the Peace, which was then made by the Parliaments Authority. In ſine, an extream feud riſe between them, and the Parliament came to that point, that they ceaſed to perform their Offices in the adjudging private cauſes, yet not without taking care for all that concerned the Kings ſervice. This quarrel made a great noiſe in <hi>Guienne,</hi> and had it continued untill the Hugonots next revolt, they had doubtleſſe taken advantage of it, it being certain that every one lives as himſelf pleaſeth, when Magiſtrates are together by the ears in their particular quarrel. The King finding of what conſequence it might prove, diſpatched the <hi>Sieur de Leon</hi> to <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> to diſpoſe the Duke to give the
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:56802:92"/>Parliament ſatisfaction, and to continue the correſpondence which they ought to hold together for the publick good. The <hi>Sieur de Leon</hi> came thither, and finding the Parliament reſolute, that the Duke ſhould give them ſatisfaction for his fault, could gain nothing more of the Duke then onely this, that he would go to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament and pay them ſome complements of honour and reſpect. The Parliament was not contented with it, ſo their accommodation was deferred, till at laſt the news being come, that the Engliſh Fleet was at Sea, every one addreſſed himſelf to ſerve the King, and to hinder their landing in <hi>Guienne:</hi> And then the Cardinal <hi>de Sourdis,</hi> Arch Biſhop of <hi>Bourdeaux</hi> interpoſing between them, perſwaded the Parliament to be ſatisfied with thoſe reſpects of honour and complements which the Duke of <hi>Eſpernon</hi> would pay unto them.

                  <p>JT is not dangerous ſometimes for his Majeſties ſervice, to permit Parliaments and Governours to fall out amongſt themſelves; for they diſcovering one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers defects by their diviſion, give occaſion to redreſs them, and withall, each one feareth to offend, that he may not give advantage to the other to impeach him. It keepeth affairs in an equal ballance, and produceth the ſame effects, as a weight equally divided in two Scales, which hindreth the over-ballancing of either part. If they alwaies ſhould continue in a ſtrict intelligence, each of them would do that without contradiction which beſt pleaſed himſelf, and their Soveraign never the wiſer. Thus ſaid <hi>Cato</hi> to them, who thought the quarrel between <hi>Pompey</hi> and <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar</hi> had ruined the Common-wealth. It is true, it did not a little contribute to that diſorder which was then on foot, but the friendſhip which had formerly been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them, was the firſt and chief cauſe. Their good intelligence gave <hi>Caeſar</hi> means to grow the greater, who afterwards finding it begin to break by the decea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of <hi>Pompey</hi> and <hi>Craſſus,</hi> their wives which ſerved to preſerve it, there fell out great broyls between them concerning the Government; <hi>Caeſar</hi> being unwilling that <hi>Pompey</hi> ſhould have more authority then himſelf, and <hi>Pompey</hi> that <hi>Caeſer</hi> ſhould be his equall. The Senate finding that divers Magiſtrates of <hi>Rome</hi> neglected their duties, and that every thing went to decay, choſe <hi>Pompey</hi> ſole Conſul, giving him an extraordinary Authority to ballance the power of the Magiſtrates, and to redreſs thoſe Delinquencies which they might or had committed. <hi>Seneca</hi> with great rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon compared this diviſion among chief Magiſtrates to the Stones in a Vault, which do ſo much conduce to the ſtrengthening of it, that the more weight is laid on it, the ſtronger it bears it up; whereas it would eaſily be broken, if made of one ſtone alone. In fine, this little emulation is much conducing to the diſcovery of abuſes, to the looking more ſtrictly into things, and the keeping every one in his duty. It is to be wiſhed that Parliaments and Governours were firmly united toward his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties ſervice, and that there were no way but this for the well governing of a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince; but it is not poſſible long to preſerve that temperative in their authority no more then in the four humours of mans body; and it is more expedient to ſearch for means of advantage from their diſorder then to ſtudy waies to ſettle them in an immutable intelligence. One of the chief is, when a Parliament pretends to aſſume too great an Authority, to oppoſe the power of a Governour, and if a Governor abuſe his power, to prevent him by the Authority of a Parliament: And thus was it according to <hi>Tacitus,</hi> that the Roman common people, ballancing the Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties power, did along while prefer their liberty. Yet above all, it would be neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to hinder ſuch diſſentions from too much claſhing, and that the Parliament and Governours be not left alone to flie out into extremities, from whence ſtrange accidents might follow. If heat or any other quality of mans body ſuper-abound, either death follows, or at leaſt great ſickneſſe; and doubtleſſe ſuch conteſts hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:56802:92"/>among Governours, either in Kingdomes or Common wealths are ſufficient to deſtroy them, or at leaſt breed great diſorders amongſt them. The diviſions which ſo often grew hot between the Roman people, and the Senate, cauſed great evils; and when the quarrels of <hi>Marius</hi> and <hi>Sylla, Pompey</hi> and <hi>Caeſar</hi> did break out, every one ſiding with ſome party, took up Arms, from whence followed ſtrange murthers, and Tragedies, and the Peoples Liberty became inſlaved to the Emperours Will.</p>

                  <p>VVHileſt theſe different affairs happened within the Kingdome, the King was not ignorant of thoſe great preparations made by the Engliſh to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade <hi>France.</hi> The happy addreſſe wherewith Heaven had bleſſed <hi>Monſieur</hi> the Cardinal, enabling him to diſcover the moſt ſecret of Forraign Affairs, gave him to underſtand all the particulars of their deſigns; his Majeſty thus informed of their reſolution, ſuddenly hoiſed Sail and reſolved to go from <hi>Paris</hi> to <hi>Rochel,</hi> that he might incourage his Souldiers, to whom nothing is invincible when he is in preſence. But God who over-ruleth the deſigns of all men, did not permit the effecting of it, ſo ſoon as his Majeſty deſired. It pleaſed his Providence to viſit him with ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe from the firſt day of his departure from <hi>Paris,</hi> which encreaſing, forced him to ſtay at <hi>Villeroy:</hi> His fits were ſo violent that his recovery was queſtioned. The Phyſitians imagining that the ſenſe of Affairs did increaſe his Feaver, beſeeched his Majeſty to dis-burthen his thoughts of it; and experience having told him, that it was but reaſonable, he committed all to the Queen Mothers and the Cardinals ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement. But the Queen Mother was ſo troubled at this accident, that her ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe would not give her leave to think on any thing. The whole burthen then lay upon the Cardinal. Not but that grief too had made a great impreſſion upon his Soul, as well as upon the Queen Mothers; but as great ſpirits quit not the helm at the violence of the ſtorm; ſo he behaved himſelf in the giving ſuch Orders as were neceſſary and conducing to prevent the Engliſh Fleets attempt, together with the Rebellion of the <hi>Rochelois,</hi> that it ſeemed Heaven had preſerved all his ſences to him to increaſe his glory. It cannot be denied, but that this was one of the moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable affairs that had a long time happened to the Kingdome. It was a part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing blow, upon which depended the ſettlement of the publick quiet, and which particularly concerned the glory of his Maſter. So he gave himſelf up to imploy his utmoſt induſtry in it, and his prudence effected ſuch things, which cannot paſſe but for miracles.</p>
                  <p>Indeed it was ſo much the eaſier for him ſo to do, ſince the King had comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him to eaſe himſelf, as much as poſſible he could for his health ſake, which did not well agree with the continual cares of this Grand Miniſter: He had induced his Majeſty to think good, that he ſhould take for his ſhare, the care of what related to his Majeſties glory, or the conduct of his State. This moderation of his was to be admired at, and ſuch as few are indued with. In that he repreſented to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty that having intruſted the Seals with <hi>Marillac,</hi> who was a perſon Active, Live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and full of Underſtanding, he might abſolutely depend upon him for the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, and on the Marqueſſe <hi>de Effiat</hi> in matters of the Treaſuries of which he had made him ſuper-intendent, which being thus, he could apply all his care to the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the State, and give a happy diſpatch to all his Majeſties commands. And laſtly, that he did not think it either proper or profitable for <hi>France,</hi> or any other State, that one man alone ſhould have the over-ſeeing of all manner of affairs, for that imploying one part of his mind on thoſe of Juſtice and the Treaſury, hee muſt have ſo much the leſſe ability to look after the reſt of the Kingdome, which in <hi>France</hi> too would take up one mans whole care and time. His Majeſty did not a
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:56802:93"/>little eſteem both his judgement and modeſty; far different from the Ambition of divers other Miniſters, who are never ſatisfied untill they rule all, ſo he was pleaſed to admit of his requeſt, which he did the more readily grant, in regard hee thought it might much conduce to his health, which could not long ſubſiſt under the care of all things, though he knew he had a Soul able to govern the whole world. From that time forward, he medled onely in matters of State, and left all the reſt to the other Miniſters.</p>

                  <p>A Prudent Miniſter who knows the work of well-governing a Kingdome, never burthens himſelf with the care of all manner of Affairs. He who pretends to a ſuper-intendency of all buſineſſes, is a raſh inconſiderate man, and he will find nothing but confuſion in his Government, and hatred upon his perſon. The Soul of man of what quality ſoever he be, is like a River whoſe courſe runs but weakly and ſlowly when exhauſted into ſeveral little Brooks; and true it is, who ſo divideth the ſtrength of his <hi>Genius,</hi> in the management of all affairs, can act but feebly in thoſe of great weight, and by conſequence to the detriment of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick good. It is with Souls as with Appetites, they who ſuffer themſelves to bee drawn along by ſawces and delicate meats, over-charge themſelves, and convert the greateſt part of their nouriſhment into ill humours, thus thoſe minds which would govern all, leave all in diſorder. <hi>Plutarch</hi> ſpeaking of the Government of a Kingdome ſaith, that the Prince ought to be like a hand, which ſhould imploy ſeveral Miniſters under his Authority; the hand hath divers fingers to work. There need no other proof of this truth, then that knowledge and prudence which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in the Conduct of a State; beſides the adminiſtration of Juſtice, and the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perintendency of the Treaſuries. A chief Miniſter ought to have his eye not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon all things, affairs, and perſons of concernment in the Kingdome; but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe upon all the bordering Princes and Allies; yes, and upon their Miniſters too, to diſcover if poſſible their deſigns, and either by policy or force to break ſuch, as may be any way prejudicial to his Maſter.</p>
                  <p>He ought to have his Engines on work, to dive into the Counſels of the Pope, the Emperour, the Spaniard, and all other neighbour Princes. He ought from time to time to acquaint himſelf with their humours, their inclinations, paſſion, exerciſes, and all that may conduce to the Government. In caſe any of them at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt a deſign which may make them too potent, he is bound to oppoſe it. If his Allies be ſet upon, he muſt be as careful to defend &amp; protect them, as the out-guards of his Kingdome. As for that which is conſiderable at home, the King his Maſter will take up a great deal of his time, either in his applications to preſerve his favour, or to diſſipate ſuch jealouſies as his enemies may have infuſed into him, or to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to his Majeſty ſuch expedients and counſels, as may be proper and profitable together. The Princes of the blood too, will find him ſome work to keep them in ſuch a condition as they may not trouble the publick Peace; but that they may however live in ſome kind of ſatisfaction, it being true, that either the good or bad Fortune of a Kingdome, doth moſt commonly depend upon them: He ought al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to have an eye upon the Clergy and Prelates, to keep them in ſuch <hi>decorum,</hi> that they claſh not by any miſ-underſtandings to the bringing of Religion into contempt: That they do not ſo greedily ſwallow down the reſpects which are paid unto them as to abuſe that power of Souls which is intruſted with them, in prejudice of the Kings royal authority. What care ought he to have to maintain the chief Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of the Crown, the Governours of Provinces and Towns, and generally all the Grandees of the Kingdome in their duties, doth it not concern him to know what ever conſiderable thing is done amongſt them, their deſigns, Cabals, Intereſts, Abilities, and their very inclinations, that he may take order with them according to their diſpoſitions, and the common good, and to divert ſuch Mutinies as they may in time raiſe? ought not his duty lead him to look into the Commerce and
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:56802:93"/>Trade, that it be preſerved in it's greatneſs as the Fountain of the Kingdomes wealth? The Common Rabble will call upon his thoughts ſometimes to be reſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in the duties they owe their King and Country: But what proportion of his time then will the affairs of war take up, when there is a neceſſity of raiſing Forces? Will it not behoove him to give all neceſſary diſpatches, either for quarterings or marching of Regiments, or to lead them on to fight with courage either for amu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition, or the exact obſervation of militarie diſcipline? It would need a long diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours particularly ſo ſet down the great duties of a principal Miniſter, but the Briefneſs which I have propoſed to follow, gives me not leave to deſcribe them, Theſe are enough to gueſſe that he will have ſomewhat to do to go through with them, and that upon theſe conſiderations a Chief Miniſter ought to be ſatisfied and totally to acquiet himſelf, of the Burthens which accompany both the Juſtice and Treaſuries.</p>

                  <p>DUring his Majeſties ſickneſs about ſix in the morning upon the 28 of <hi>July</hi> the Engliſh Fleet appeared about <hi>Olonne</hi> between 18 and 20 Ships. At firſt it was ſuppoſed they were Dunkerkers, who might have perchance ſome deſign upon the Dutch Fleet then in the Road. But when they were perceived to draw neer the Ile of <hi>Ree,</hi> that their number encreaſed, and the Hollanders not affraid of them, it was eaſily concluded that they were the Engliſh Fleet, of which there was quickly a greater aſſurance, when they ſaw all their Ships at anchor at the mouth of <hi>Breton</hi> neer the Cape <hi>d' Ars.</hi> The reſt drew neer one of the Forts in the Ile of <hi>Ree</hi> called <hi>La Pree,</hi> againſt which they ſhot very much all day long, and the next day too until night in ſo much that the Ships encompaſſed the Point of <hi>Sablanceau,</hi> within half musket ſhot of the Land, and ſome of them adventured within Piſtol ſhot: Which made the <hi>Sieur de Thoyras,</hi> then Governour of the Cittadel St. <hi>Martin</hi> in the Ile of <hi>Ree,</hi> Judg that they intended to there abouts, ſo he drew out as many of his men as he could well ſpare to prevent their deſigns, and carried them as neer as poſſibly he could to that place, that he might fall on them in their disbarking. But their Landing being favoured by above two thouſand peeces which ſhot continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally. They had the oportunity to ſet on ſhoar about ten thouſand men. The <hi>Sieur de Thoyras</hi> had not with him above two hundred Horſe and eight hundred foot, yet it being for his Majeſties Honour to welcome them at their firſt footing, he reſolved to aſſault them, notwithſtanding the incredible violence of the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, which beat down every thing that did but appear upon the ſhore. He hoped for a good ſucceſſe from the Juſtneſs of his cauſe, and that his Souldiers would force Fortune to be favourable unto them. He divided his Horſe into ſeven parties, five of which were commanded to give the Charge, and break the Engliſh ranks, and the foot had order to follow on; the two other parties were to keep off for a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, upon the firſt ſignal of the Fight, The firſt went on in good order, but were forced to Gallop off again, for that the Engliſh Cannon put them in ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, that the moſt part of them were routed before ever they came to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage, ſome killed, ſome wounded and others unhorſed; but their courage who were in a condition to march on, ſtood firm, ſo they advanced up to the Engliſh Batta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions, and there did what ever could be expected from high reſolutions. The Engliſh aſtoniſhed to ſee the French come thundring in that manner upon them thorough the midſt of the Flames and Cannon ſhot, were put into ſuch diſorder, that many of them ſwam to their Ships. The French now finding they were not purſued, and ſeeing that they were not in condition to fight, they rallied together and charged them once more, before ever the foot came up; but at laſt they came and fell in, doing more then could be expected; but the violence of the Cannon was ſuch, that it was fit to ſound the retreat, and to expect a more favourable occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to fight with them. <hi>Roſtaincler</hi> the <hi>Sieur de Thoyras</hi> his Brother, the Baron of <hi>Chautail, Navailles</hi> and divers other Gentlemen and light Horſe, and about one
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:56802:94"/>hundred and fifty Souldiers were ſlain in the excounter, moſt part of the Officers being wounded: neither had the Engliſh a leſſe loſs. Fifteen Officers of their Army were killed beſides divers Livetenants and Enſigns. They likewiſe loſt one of their Collours, and upon a vew taken they found between five and ſix hundred killed and wounded. So they had but little ſtomack for that preſent to advance any farther into the Ilaud: but in 3 dages time they fortefied themſelves on the ſhore ſide, keeping under ſhelter of their Ships, neither would they ſtir one foot, till they were informed that the French intended to defend the Cittadel of St. <hi>Martin,</hi> and not meet them any more in the field.</p>

                  <p>I Think it impoſſible to prevent a ſtrong Fleet from landing in an <hi>Iland,</hi> where they may come on ſhore in ſundry places unfortefied. The night alone is enough to favour their landing, and admitting there were Forces enough to meet them in all places, yet the Canon would make ſuch havock, that at laſt there would be a neceſſity of giving them leave to come on ſhore. Thus hath Machiavel, and the wiſeſt Politions obſerved, That it ſeldome happened, that ever any Fleet eſpecially if accompanied with a good Army, was hindered from opening any paſſage if un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defended by a good Caſtle. When <hi>Francis</hi> the firſt undertook the war in <hi>Italy,</hi> The Spaniards being on t'other ſide the River <hi>Beuchamby,</hi> with very great Forces to hinder his paſſage, were forced to make way for him, when they ſaw <hi>Monſieur de Guiſe,</hi> with his Sword in his hand followed by all the Troops to take water that they might come fight with them. In the like manner <hi>Philip de Valois</hi> having com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded <hi>Godemar du Fay</hi> to keep the Paſſage of the River <hi>Somme</hi> at <hi>Blanchetacque</hi> with a thouſand men at Armes beſides the <hi>Bowman</hi> of <hi>Genoa,</hi> and ſix thouſand foot did quickly notwithſtanding all this ſee the Engliſh Army force the paſſe, and in leſſe then ſix howers, to be all over, whilſt the Sea flowed back again. It were eaſie to produce many the like examples. But I rather think the wiſeſt courſe which can be taken on ſuch occaſions is to make them pay dearly for their Landing by cutting good ſtore of them in peeces, and to adventure on them at their firſt foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with courage and reſolution. The firſt attempts are they which make way for all the reſt. An Enemy finds himſelf aſtoniſhed at the death of ſome of his party, and at the great reſiſtance which he meeteth. The difficulties which are forſeen in obtaining of victories diſheartens all thoſe who have but a little courage: and it hath been often found that an enemy will more willingly retier himſelf, then run the hazard of a ſecond rout. Cruelty is allowable in ſuch occaſions, to ſtrick terrour into an enemy, to ſhake their reſolutions, and to affright them, for many from fearfall to deſpair of victorie, whilſt they judg, conſidering the ſtrong reſiſtance made in defence of a paſs, it muſt needs be a mark of the aſſured reſolution they have taken to defend themſelves in a place when once they are beſieged.</p>

                  <p>THE newes of the Engliſh Fleets arrival was ſoon brought to the Court, but the Cardinals Prudence was ſuch that he would not let the King be acquainted with it, leaſt it might encreaſe his Fever, neverthleſſe his Great <hi>Genius,</hi> who fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth remedies for all things, did take wonderful care by his orders to repel them. The King had already, upon Intelligence that the Engliſh were ſetting out, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded many Regiments of Foot and Troops of light Horſe and diſpatched ſeveral Commiſſions to raiſe more Forces with order to all Officers, to come to the rande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous at <hi>Poictou,</hi> and there to be in a readineſs, for ſuch imployments as occaſion ſhould require: He had alſo given the charge of this Army to the Duke of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gouleſme,</hi> who at his firſt comming, gave all neceſſary orders, for the ſafetie of Brouage, and the Iles of <hi>Oleron,</hi> relying entierly as to the Ile of <hi>Ree,</hi> on the cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and Loyalty of the <hi>Sieur de Thoyras, Monſieur d' Angouleſme</hi> had alſo put into
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:56802:94"/>Fort <hi>Lewis,</hi> all kinds of Ammunition with great diligence, whereby to repel the Engliſh, if they ſhould come to aſſault it and he made uſe of a Stratagem, which was the probable cauſe of ſtaying the Engliſh at the Ile of <hi>Ree,</hi> as alſo of prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them from coming on the <hi>Mainland.</hi> His deviſe was this; He gave order, upon his firſt comming to the Quarter Maſter General of the Army to go to all the Boroughs and Villages there abouts, to provide Quarters for an Army between fifteen and twenty thouſand men, though he had not in all; above the half of that number.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Rochelois</hi> hereupon ſwallowing this fiction for a truth, preſently adviſed the Engliſh of it, who apprehending the encounter of ſo great Forces, went to the Ile of <hi>Ree.</hi> He alſo obſerved the order given him by the Cardinal, not to provoke the <hi>Rochelois,</hi> nor give them the leaſt jealouſie of any thought to beſiege them. This Great Miniſter well knew, That the people are eaſily tranſported to all extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, when they fear any ſevere puniſhment to fall upon them, and particularly that the <hi>Rochelois</hi> having called in the Engliſh to vindicate their Liberty, would never be induced totally to give themſelves up to them, whilſt they did not fear a ſiege, and that therefore it would be proper, not to give them any ſuſpition. And for the ſame reaſon it was, that the Duke of <hi>Angouloſme,</hi> did ſo favourably receive their Deputies, aſſuring them, that the King intended nothing elſe, but to let them enjoy their priviledges, on condition they deſerved it by their ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; he alſo ſuffered them to gather in their harveſts thinking it leſſe inconvenient to let them make that proviſion, which at beſt could not much prolong the ſiege, then to give them occaſien, by declaring their deſign to deliver up themſelves to the Engliſh.</p>
                  <p>This diſpoſal of his was accompanied with great Prudence, yet not ſufficient to drive the Engliſh out of the Ile of <hi>Ree,</hi> or hinder them being Maſters thereof to go on the <hi>Mainland.

                  <p>PRudence is a Helmet which ſecureth a Kingdom from all ſiniſter accidents which may betide it. It is the Eye of a Miniſter, of State which helpeth him to ſee all that is needful to be done, as his valour is the hand which ſerves him to put it in execution. Without it, he were more feeble then a Blind man; and might expect nothing but confuſion from the reſiſtances which he ſhall make againſt the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of the State; whereas with Prudence every thing is poſſible. <hi>Antiquity</hi> hath ſaid that a Wiſe man is Fortunes Maſter, and that there is not any thing in the power of that blind Goddeſs, but is ſubjected to the Laws of vertue; and which may not be diverted by the prudent Counſel of a Wiſe man. <hi>Plutarch</hi> on the life of <hi>Fabius</hi> ſaith, God only gives good ſucceſſe to mens actions, according to their being meſſured by vertue and Prudence; and the Example of the Emperour <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonius</hi> the <hi>Debonnaire,</hi> may ſerve to Illuſtrate this truth; He had ſo many good ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes in all his undertakings, it is ſaid he never repented of any his reſolutions, and that he ſaw all his deſigns come to paſſe according as he contrived them; Now a certain Roman Senator taking the boldneſs, to aske him the reaſon of it, after he had teſtified how much he eſteemed his conduct, and with what wonder he was poſſeſſed to ſee ſo happy an end crown all his endeavours; he was anſwered that he did as much as was poſſible, foreſee all thoſe accidents which might fall out and thereupon he prepared proper remedies for them: That he ſpared neither his care nor diſcretion, to bring his deſigns to paſſe, and that he committed the executing of them to perſon fit for it: This is the Rule of Prudence, and true it is that as the light of the Sun ſhews the way to any place where a man would go; ſo this vertue when poſſeſſed in any eminent degree, inlightens the Soul of a Miniſter with ſo much Splendor, that it gives him a means to obtain whatever he can propoſe to himſelf. It diſcovereth to him infallible wayes to arrive unto the ends of his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings, guideth his motions, ordereth his Counſels, regulateth his affections, compoſeth his Actions, Governeth his wiſdome, appointeth his orders, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covereth to him, whatever is able to ſtop the courſe of his deſigns: And as it teacheth never to attempt impoſſibilities ſo it is a moſt certain way to arrive unto whatever is within compaſſe of being brought to paſſe. And thus it may ſafely be ſaid, that by Prudence it is, that God doth prepare the wayes of happineſs and good ſucceſſe for mankind.</p>

<pb n="179" facs="tcp:56802:95"/>and that he would take care to hunt out all the French.

To which purpoſe, he made his approaches upon the Cittadel on the ſixth day after his arrival, and on the ſeventh commanded ſix peece of Cannon to be planted upon the Port of <hi>St. Martin,</hi> who began to batter the place from day break with ſuch effect, that beating all down where the Mills ſtood, they wanteſt but little of bearing them clear away; but the beſieged laboured with that dexteriouſneſſe and diligence that they covered, and ſo ſaved them; and withall their Battery ſhot at that of the Engliſh, ſo luckily, that they ſoon diſmounted all their Cannon.

But above all, on the very firſt day he made uſe of one for to ſecure a Haven where ſuch Barques as came to releeve him, might land in ſafety, and raiſed a work round about it upon the ſhore-ſide, which he kept as carefully as the Cittadel it ſelf, and from thence it was that he received thoſe ſuccours which afterwards delivered him out of trouble. The enemies Trenches were not ſuch, but that he had intelligence with thoſe of the Iſland, eſpecially the Catholiques, who were a good number, and ſuch as might furniſh him with many neceſſaries for the Cittadel; which the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> perceiving, ſent them all away in Boats, ſo that there was now no other hopes of relief but from the main land.

In the defence of a Place four things ought to bee obſerved, The Governour, the Souldiers, The Fortifications, and the Ammunitions. As for that which concerneth the Commander in Chief, he ought to be a perſon of an unqueſtionable fidelity, not to be corrupted by mony, one whoſe courage is invincible, and who knoweth not what fear is; His vigilance ought to be extream great, and uncapable of ſurpriſe, he ought to have a body enured to labour, and uſed to undergo the Inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of a town and ill diet; to have a confidence in his Souldiers that he may lead
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:56802:96"/>them on whether ever he pleaſeth. The choiſe of Souldiers is no leſſe obſervable, and it were a madneſſe to make uſe of new raiſed Troops, unacquainted with trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble or the buſineſs of war; None but old experienced Souldiers ought to be put in a place of concernment; For this reaſon was it that the Romans alwayes diſpoſed ſuch old Soldiers as could no longer keep the field, into Garriſon: For all Fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations how ſtrong ſo ever, are to little purpoſe, if they be not animated by the courage and vallour of the Souldiers within them. Courage is a thing ſo potent, that by it we have ſeen many places defended againſt moſt great Armies; Fortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions however ought not to be neglected, but on the contrary, in caſe they be not regular and in good order, when a place is firſt beſieged, then he who is overſeer of them ought to work day and night with extraordinary care and dilligence until they be brought to a condition, of not fearing any aſſault. It is impoſſible whole to defend them from the violence of the Cannon, but the Governour ought alwayes to have in readineſs good ſtore of Baskets Faggots, ſacks of wool, and Hogsheads filled with earth to make up any Breaches, which ſhall be made. Now as to that which relateth to Munitions of war and victuals. The care of them is not leſſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable, for that the Souldiers who are to defend a place muſt both eat and fight, and he who is Governour of them muſt make ſure of ſuch proviſions, as may ſuffice to endure the ſiedg to the very utmoſt. No exact meaſure can be ſet down, but they ought to be proportioned to the places themſelves, ſo that if the place be Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable for a long ſiedg there ought then to be a greater quantity of proviſion made, and if it be lyable to a ſurpriſe by aſſault then the leſſe will ſerve turn. If in caſe there ſhould be any defect in making of neceſſary proviſion, he is then obliged to uſe his utmoſt care and endeavour for the bringing of it to the place, his ruine being unavoidable, if he want means to prevent it; and that he may ſecure away to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive ſuch proviſions he muſt as much as poſſibly he may make ſure of the Avenues of the Port, if it be a Sea Town, and if it be an Inland place then thoſe paſſes which lye next to it.

That which moſt of all perplexed them was, that the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh made ſeveral inventions, to ſtop up the mouth of the haven, and to prevent the means of their ſuccours; they firſt of all built a certain Fort upon three or four great Ships faſt tied together, upon which they planted eight or ten piece of Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, to hit between wind and water any boats that ſhould attempt to paſſe: they made a certain raing of Ships before the place, which ſhut up the paſſage: Withall they tied great Cabals from one veſſel to another, upon which they hung certain barrels to keep them up above water, and hinder any relief. The Sea indeed and the winds laugh'd at their deviſes, overwhelming them in the water, ſo that the Engliſh were forced to unty their Cables, ſeeing in what danger their Ships were, when the wind began to riſe and the Sea to be troubled; But however, they having
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:56802:96"/>blocked up the paſſage, ſo that it was impoſſible for the beſieged to ſend or receive any boats to or from the many Land, it the much troubled them, and diverſe Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers of the Cittadel annoyed with hunger and other neceſſities found means to get out and ſurrender themſelves to the enemy, diſcovering the ſtraits to which the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged were reduced: Whereupon the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> that he might make uſe of this advantage, writ to the <hi>Sieur de Thoyras,</hi> where after he had highly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended his courage, he invited him to ſurrender himſelf and deliver up and place upon honourable conditions, that he might withdraw himſelf from that imminent peril to which he was like to be expoſed, by the evil treatment, which if van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed, he would force upon himſelf. The <hi>Sieur de Thoyras</hi> endured this neceſſity with delight, becauſe it was accompanied with glory, nor was he at all moved at the receipt of the Letter; but he returned anſwer to the Duke, that neither the deſpair of relief, nor the fear of being ill treated, though to the greateſt extremity, ſhould ever be able to make him quit his deſign of defending the place; That he confeſſed himſelf obliged to him for his civil propoſal, but that he ſhould think himſelf unworthy of any of his favours, ſhould he omit any one point of his duty in this occaſion, the ſucceſſe of which could not but be very honourable unto him, However, that he might take off from the impatience of the Engliſh, he thought it proper, and that by the Councel of his friends to pretend a Treaty with them, which he continued with ſuch addreſſe, that his enemies verily believed that his thoughts were enclined rather to ſurrender than to gain time in hopes of relief: The Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> ſuppoſing it impoſſible that they ſhould be relieved, conſidering his engines, and the great number of his Ships, which lay in the Roade before the place, ſought rather to face the beſieged by famine than to run new hazards by aſſaulting them after his firſt ill ſucceſſe. In the mean while as neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty doth quicken induſtry, ſo the <hi>Sieur de Thoyras</hi> found means to ſend three Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers to the Main Land by ſwimming, to give his Majeſty notice of the condition in which he was, &amp; to haſten away relief.

                  <p>ONe of the greateſt difficulties, to which a man can be brought in ordinary ſeiges is the inability of ſending intelligence to them, from whom he doth expect relief; and one of them greateſt cares of the who beſiege a place, is to ſtop all wayes that nothing way paſſe in or out. Some have made uſe of the night for this purpoſe as the Goths did, when they would ſend news to <hi>Vitigez,</hi> being beſieged in <hi>Ormuz,</hi> by <hi>Belligarius;</hi> they made a great noiſe at one of the Gates, pretending as if they would ſally out upon their enemies, to the intent that <hi>Belliſarius</hi> might draw all his Forces theither and leave but a few at that quarter, by which they deſigned to ſend away their Meſſenger. A Stratagem indeed very advantagious, when mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with prudence. The ſame Goths, as <hi>Procopus</hi> reports, uſed another deviſe upon the ſame occaſion to ſend news to <hi>Vitigez,</hi> which was, They corrupted ſome ſentinels for mony, an invention eaſy to be practiſed in civil wars, where both par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are acquainted with one another. But that which is the moſt certain way, which they who are beſieged may make uſe of, to ſend a broad intelligence, ought to be guided by diſcretion, according as occaſions preſent themſelves, and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted them with all poſſible addreſſe; for it is an art, not to be laid down by cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Rules, neither can it be learned by precepts; but natural induſtry infuſeth it by diverſe inſtincts, and experience teacheth it in war. I ſhall onely add that there
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:56802:97"/>are ſundry and divers means to be met with in Hiſtory, which great Captains have uſed on this occaſion. The Campany being beſiged by the Romans, ſent a man, who counterfeyted himſelf mad, with letters for the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> in his girdle, <hi>Hircius Conſul,</hi> writ to <hi>Decius Brutus</hi> then beſieged in <hi>Modena</hi> by <hi>Antonius,</hi> and ſent his Letters made up in lead, faſtned to the Arms of thoſe who ſwam over the River. The ſame man did ſome times keep up Pidgeons in the dark without giving them to eat, and then finding them almoſt famiſhed, carried them as near the place as poſſibly he could, then let them go; which flying to the houſes with their letters about their necks, were either taken down or killed by <hi>Brutus. Juſtine</hi> reports that <hi>Harpagus,</hi> that he might conveigh Letters to <hi>Cyrus,</hi> put them up in the belly of an hare and ſent them by a faithful Servant, who paſſed through King <hi>Arbactus</hi> guardes for an Huntſman.</p>
                  <p>Others have uſed as many different deviſed, as their wits and opportunities could attaine to. That which ought to be obſerved, is this, that ſuch Letters ought not to be writ in Characters or ſuch cyphers which are legible. We are not now in <hi>Caeſars</hi> dayes; who deſigning to ſend <hi>Cicero</hi> word that he was at hand to relieve him, writ to him onely in Greek: At this time there are no cyphers, which are not eaſily found out. It were fit that they were like the Characters of Chinenſes, which ſignifie things not Letters, who writing as many different Characters as there are things, it muſt needs be an hard matter to decypher them. Theſe Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters, too for the greater ſecurity ſhould be writ with the juyce of Limmons or Onyons between the Lines of Letters, in which there is nothing of concern, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that which is writ with this juyce cannot be read, but by water or fire. It were not amiſſe too, if he who is Governour, before the ſiedg, agree with him to whom he would ſend intelligences of the manner he would write to him, and there might be onely certain words in each line, which compoſed together ſhould diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover his thoughts, and yet taken with the reſt, would be thought to treat of other buſineſſe than that which is really intended.</p>

                  <p>THE Relief of the Iſland was due to the Cardinal after his great or rather ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream care. One of the chiefeſt means he uſed to effect it was this, He ſent to <hi>Bayonne</hi> for 15 flat veſſels, called Primaces, built both to ſail and row and withal very fleet, and able to endure a ſtorm, He judged by his prudence, that the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh having none of this faſhion, they might eaſily get to <hi>Ree</hi> in the night, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being diſcovered. The order was diſpatched to the Count <hi>de Grand-Mont</hi> with command to put them under the conduct of the <hi>Sieur de Chalar</hi> Captain of one of the Kings Ships, then in <hi>Spain,</hi> and in caſe he ſhould not be come back, then to whom he thought fit. The Count provided the 15 Primaces with all haſte, he armed then with Muſquets and piks the beſt he could, in each of them he put 20 ſeamen, and took care if nothing was wanting. The <hi>Sieur de Chalar</hi> not being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned, he committed the conduct of them to Captain <hi>Baſlin,</hi> one of the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced and ſtouteſt Sea Captain in thoſe Parts. About the end of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> he came with his Primaces to the Sands of <hi>Olonne,</hi> where the Abbot of <hi>Marſillac</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived him with great joy, and his veſſels being well ſtored with victuals add am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition, he lent him ſix ſcore men of the Regiment <hi>de Champany</hi> with ſome Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntiers, to put off upon the firſt occaſion. Upon the fifth of <hi>September,</hi> he ſet ſail in the head of his little Fleet about 6 of the clock at night. Soon after he knew that he was near the Enemies Fleet, he ſpead abroad his great ſailes, and was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently diſcovered. But the Primaces going very ſwift could not be ſtopped by the Engliſh Veſſels; they went without loſſe, onely ſome ſails and one or two Maſts were ſhattered, and one ſhot through with a bullet. <hi>Baſlin</hi> having thus paſſed the Enemies, fell upon the <hi>Baracado</hi> which they had made, to hunder relief, which conſiſted of great Maſts linked together with iron chains and tied with Cabels faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to great Anchors; however many of the Primances by reaſon, of their light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:56802:97"/>and ſwiftneſs paſſed over, the reſt as it pleaſed God did light upon a certain place, where the foregoing night a tempeſt had broken part of their <hi>Baracado,</hi> through which they paſſed without difficulty; ſo that about two in the night they ran aſhore near one of the <hi>Baſtilions</hi> of the Cittadel, a place where the Engliſh could not hurt them. The relief was great both for their reputation and aſſiſtance; It came ſo opportunely, that it gave them new courage, who were till then hardly able to breath, and it may ſafely be ſaid that this one action was the deciding of the controverſie. The paſſage was afterward clear, The beſieged perſwaded them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves that they ſhould now want nothing, and the Engliſh were ſo aſtoniſhed at it, that they ſent to his Majeſties <hi>Hab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Diverſe other veſſels attempted to paſſe unto the <hi>Iſland,</hi> but being heavier than the Pinnaces, they were forced to go off, ſome one way and ſome another through the Engliſh Fleet. It was then reſolved, that 10 other Pinnaces ſhould be got from <hi>Bayonne,</hi> which the Count <hi>de Grant-Mont</hi> rigged out and ſent under the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of Captain <hi>Audoum,</hi> upon the 4 of <hi>October</hi> they came upon the Sands of <hi>Olonne,</hi> They were ſoon laded and accompanied with 25 other little Veſſels, 300 Soldiers went abroad them and 60 choice Gentlemen. Upon the 6 of <hi>October</hi> they put off. The <hi>Sieur de Cuſar,</hi> and Captain <hi>Audouin</hi> were Commanders of the Squadron.

The Engliſh Fleet ſoon diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered them, and engaged them in a rough fight.

                  <p>THE Relieving of a place is of ſuch importance, that without it no place is able to hold out, when the beſiegers appear to be reſolute before it. He who relieves them, is acknowledges for their deliver, and does conſiderable ſervice to his Prince. Although Sea-Ports are more eaſily aſſiſted than Inland Towns, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially with a ſtrong Fleet, becauſe it is hard, if the winds, which with their incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy have an abſolute Empire over the Sea, ſhould not at ſome one time or other preſent a favourable occaſion to break through all the obſtacles, which their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies Ships can make; yet it is not the ſame thing when there is a want of great Ships to fight with thoſe of the Enemy. When it happens thus, Prudence joyned with Fortune muſt ſurpaſſe all thoſe difficulties, which oppoſe the relief of the place. There muſt of neceſſity be an expectation till Fortune preſents a favourable wind, without which, what were it but raſhly to run into danger? But when the wind ſits right, the opportunity ought not to be loſt, and then a wiſe Pilot guided by his induſtry, may hope for a good ſucceſſe from his enterpriſe.</p>
                  <p>The Chief points, which he ought to obſerve, are, to provide ſtore of light veſſels, which may paſſe the quicker. For beſides that deligence, the Mother of good ſucceſſe, it is particularly needful, when a ſtrong Fleet is to be broke through; and it gives great advantages, in regard the Enemies great Ships cannot ſail ſo nimbly. It is true the light ones may be ſtopped by the Enemies which are of the ſame bulk, but it is an hard matter, if carrying a great number for the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour,
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:56802:98"/>ſome ſhould not eſcape, eſpecially, becauſe the ſmaller veſſels of the enemy are uſually diſperſed abroad upon the guard and cannot ſo quickly come into the fight; for that wind which is good to ſome, is contrary to others, and the ſuccours having no great number of Ships for fight, one part advanceth through, whiles the others bears the brunt.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, it were neceſſary to be very ſecret in providing the Convoy, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Barques; and if it be poſſible to prevent the Enemies knowledge of it, they will not be ſo ſtrict in their watch, a diſperſing their ſmall veſſels abroad. Withal an Enemy taken unprepared is not ſo terrible as when adviſed, and in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſſe. The night gives a great help, and ought chiefly be made choiſe of, as well for its darkneſs, which hinders their being diſcovered, as becauſe then great Ships dare not be too bold leſt they run on ground, ſo that the little ones are they which muſt purſue the fight. But above all the Command ought to be given to a couragious prudent Captain, followed by choiſe Soldiers, Victory being obtained more by vallour then multitude. Such men ought to be choſen, who neither fear Muſquet nor Canon, but are reſolved to run the hazard. Canons indeed are not much to be feared in the night, becauſe they can hardly be levelled a right by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the darkneſs, and the ſwiftneſs of the veſſels motion.</p>

He was extream care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for the bringing up of the Forces to the Camp, and oftentimes attempted the relief of the Iſle of <hi>Ree,</hi> and to keep the Army in diſcipline. The King arrived at <hi>Rochel.</hi> and teſtified a great ſatisfaction at his extraordinary conduct by <hi>Careſſes,</hi> ſufficient to have obliged him, to have expected the iſſue of ſuch glorious deſigns in his Majeſties company, had not his confidence diverted him from it and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded him after the defeat of the Engliſh to return to <hi>Paris.</hi> They made him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that the Cardinal had all the authority and that himſelf had onely the name, although this Grand Miniſter was never deficient in paying him all reſpects.

This was the true reaſon, which carried <hi>Monſieur</hi> back to <hi>Paris,</hi> his Highneſs having given more credit to their councels, which he thought were accompanied with faithfulneſs than to his own paſſion, which carried him on to the wars, when he might teſtify his cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage to be no way inferiour to his birth.</p>

If but a little be added to the greatneſs of their birth, they become too potent and aſſume too great authority. The deſire of Command, which their birth hath given them, doth blind their minds, when they find themſelves with their Swords in their hands.

                  <p>AS God is the Authour, ſo his Providence is the Governour of Kingdomes. His wiſdome is an all ſeeing eye, to look into whatever is neceſſary for them: and his hand is omnipotent to provide all waves for their glory. That Creature which is born in the Sea, finds his livelihood there. The Tree which grows on the earth, is nouriſhed there. The Fruit which owes it's birth to the Tree, owes alſo it's maturity. The Sun compleateth the Gold which he formeth, and thus States eſtabliſhed by God ought to expect all their happineſs and good ſucceſſes from his providence. That is it which infuſeth into Kings the knowledge of what is proper to be done, both in Peace and War: It is he who holdeth the hearts of all ſubjects in his hands, who inſpireth them with reſpects due to their Authority, and keepeth them in obedience. How eaſily can God humble at his own pleaſure, the minds of Rebels, abate their Fury, pull down their courage and force them to live, within their limits! And is he not the God of Battailes too, who beſtoweth victory where he pleaſeth, defendeth Juſtice by the Arms of the Souldier, ſtriketh terror amongſt his Enemies; and many times gives greater ſucceſſe, then reaſon and the means would admit to be hoped for? To him it is Kings ought to have recourſe in matters of concernment. <hi>David</hi> never went to war, but he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted with God. <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great, in that war which he made with the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians,</hi> cauſed a little Oratory in form of a Church to be carried with him, that in it he might do his devotions, and every <hi>Legion</hi> had its <hi>Templum Mobile</hi> wherein the Prieſts and Deacons ſaid Maſſe, to implore Gods aſſiſtance. By Prayers, is Peace continued, and Enemies by it are overthrown. Every Prince who is inga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in any great enterpriſe, is bound to believe it, and to have recourſe to God, by Prayers, by works of Piety and Religion, aſſuring themſelves upon his promiſe, of giving them what ever they ſhall heartily requeſt, becauſe he is juſt, and will be near them, who ſhall call upon him; that he will fulfill their deſires who fear him; Exalt the faithful, who hope in him; and keep thoſe who love him.</p>

                     <hi>Ree</hi> is relieved.</head>
                  <p>UPon the Kings arrival, all thoughts were bent to execute the reſolution taken at <hi>Paris,</hi> to ſend a ſtrong relief, into <hi>Ree,</hi> not only that the Engliſh might be forced from the ſiedge, but quite driven out of the Iſland; The Kings courage would have carried him to go fight his enemies in perſon at Sea, but the Cardinal and his Generals by their intreaties, foreſeeing into how great danger he run, perſwaded him to the contrary. His Majeſty would not by any means give leave, that the Cardinal ſhould go, but deſired, he might ſtay behind, to take the Chief care of ſending the relief upon him, it being eaſie to judg, that if his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels were ſo ſuccesful in his abſence, he might obtain by his preſence what ever could be deſired. Hereupon the Cardinal commanded, that ſome of the veſſels deſigned for the buſineſs, ſhould be made ready with whatever was neceſſary for the ſick and the ſound, with ſtore of Munition, and the day following the <hi>Sieur de Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont</hi> commanded them to Fort <hi>Delapree,</hi> which place the Engliſh did not much ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure; for they had victuals ſufficient for ſix months for one hundred men that kept it; the ſame day he likewiſe ſent order to <hi>Oleron,</hi> for the conveighing part of the Regiment of <hi>Pleſſis-Praſilin,</hi> to begin certain Trenches, and to draw certain lines and redoubts about the port which might favour the comming of the great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief; They all got ſafe in and loſt not a man; this good ſucceſſe put the reſt of the Souldiers in heart who were to paſſe thither. Without looſing more time the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> was ſent by the King to <hi>Plumb,</hi> that he might put aboard the Ships <hi>Le Sieur de Canaples,</hi> ſeven hundred men of the guard, the Regiment of <hi>Beaumout,</hi> ſome Voluntiers and good ſtore of Munition, who though he were then only eighteen year old, yet diſpoſed all things ſo prudently, as if experience had made him grow old in arms; After the five and twentith of <hi>October,</hi> the King who knew the names and perſons of moſt of his old Souldiers, had filled up all the Troops, the Maſters of the Camp, Captains, and all the reſt, who were to go. His Majeſty knew, that it is not the number which gets the victory but courage, and therefore he would not have one man amongſt them of whom he had not ſome experience: Theſe Forces commanded by the <hi>Sieur de Canoples,</hi> came all ſafe within two howers to the Fort <hi>De La Pree;</hi> The aire was of a light fire with the ſhot which were made at them, but not a Ship perſued them, ſo they received no loſſe. St. <hi>Previll</hi> ſeeing them approach, went out to diſcover who they were, and told the <hi>Sieur de Canoples,</hi> that the enemy informed of their imbarking, were in ambuſh behind cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain old houſes with intention to fall upon them at their Landing; hereupon he commanded the <hi>Sieurs de Fourille, de Malicy, de Tilladat</hi> and <hi>de Porcheus</hi> preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to Land their Souldiers, he ſhewed Serjant Major <hi>Brierees</hi> the ſeveral Poſts where every one ſhould be, and gave orders for the fight. The Duke of <hi>Bucking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> who commanded in his own perſon hearing the noiſe of their landing, drew out his Forces into three diviſions, and leading them towards the Port, they were not diſcovered until they came juſt upon the Kings Forces, and that only by the light of their Matches, ſo dark was the night. <hi>Tillades</hi>'s Chief Serjant, who led on the forlorne hope firſt eſpying them gave them a ſalute which laid ſome of them on the ground, however the reſt came on; The <hi>Sieur de Canoples</hi> ſeeing them not above fifty paces from <hi>Fourilles</hi> Squadron, reſolved, after he had propoſed it to the other Captains, to fall on them, which put an end to the buſineſs. <hi>Fourille</hi> went up and that ſo near them, that not a Muſquet was ſhot off but at puſh a Pikes. The two Battalions of the French and Engliſh diſcharged at the ſame time, the fight grew hot, Both Commanders and Souldiers, were at emulation with one another to ſhew that, it was not without reaſon, the King had made choiſe of them, in this occaſion. Their Courages ſaved them, for the Enemy was much more numerous then they were. Indeed the <hi>Sieur de Canoples</hi> good conduct did not a little further the buſineſs, for knowing the ſtrength of the Engliſh, he had commanded the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains to draw all their Souldiers, into the Counter Scarps of the Fort, but he had
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:56802:100"/>not ſo ordered his buſineſſe, had it not been in the night; for <hi>Buckingham</hi> ſeeing his firſt Battalia in diſorder, and thinking he had onely met with the Forlorn Hope, commanded a retreat. He left ſix and thirty on the place, and of his Majeſties par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, there were onely ſix and twenty killed and wounded, amongſt the reſt, <hi>Mauſan, Tourilles</hi> Lievetenant, was found dead of a Musket ſhot, and two cuts with a Halberd.</p>

                  <p>WHen there is a neceſſity at firſt daſh to fight an enemy, it is more diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to fall on him, then to expect him; and eſpecially being inferiour to him in force, for then pure valour muſt carry it. Souldiers are ever more coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious in aſſaulting then receiving an enemy. An aſſault diſtracteth an enemy, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth in ſuſpect ſome further ſtratagem, and puts him often into diſorder. <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi> made an experiment hereof, when paſſing the <hi>Helleſpont</hi> in one onely Galli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ot, he met <hi>Craſſius,</hi> Captain of the contrary Faction, with ten Gallies. A cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage leſſe reſolute then his would have endeavoured to ſave himſelf by the lightneſs of his veſſel, but in ſtead of flying be put himſelf into a poſture of defence, went directly up againſt <hi>Craſſius,</hi> and ſo terrified him, that <hi>Craſſius</hi> delivered up him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. When ſuch encounters are foreſeen, it is needful to be accompanied with choiſe reſolute Souldiers, ſuch as know not what fear is, for fear is repelled by any the leaſt reſiſtance. A timerous Souldier never yet did any thing worth notice, but to a reſolute man, every thing makes way. It is ſaid of <hi>Cajus Marius</hi> that in his youth, he was ſo hardy in all his enterpriſes, that nothing could reſiſt him, but that in his age, his Vallour decreaſed, with the heat of his Bloud which loſt him ſome part, of his reputation. <hi>Bertrand du Gueſlin</hi> was both one of the moſt vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant and Fortunate, of his times; But every one doth aſcribe thoſe great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages, which he obtained in Battails to that reſolution of his, which would ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſo tranſport him, that he would with a dozen Souldiers, fall into the midſt of his Enemies, who unable to withſtand the effects of ſo admirable a vallour, would preſently be put to diſorder. <hi>Robert de La March,</hi> hath afforded us one more notable example of the ſucceſſe which attendeth on vallour: it was in the Battail of <hi>Navarre,</hi> where being touched with a fatherly affection, he ruſhed into the Battail of the Swiſſes then victorious, that he might ſave his Sons <hi>Florange</hi> and <hi>Jamets,</hi> who lay upon the ground much wounded: Which reſolution of his was ſo ſuccesful, that though ſeconded but by a few Horſe yet it ſo terrified the <hi>Swizzers,</hi> that they could not prevent his bringing of them off in ſafety.</p>

                  <p>THe Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> finding it would be a difficult thing for him, in future to prevent the acceſſe of relief to the Iſland, as well becauſe divers Veſſels of his Fleet were loſt, as alſo by reaſon of the ſmall ſucceſſe he had hitherto had, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to make his laſt attempt upon the Cittadel of <hi>St. Martin.</hi> He was not ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of thoſe other and greater preparations which were in agitation upon the main land, to ſend a ſtronger ſupply then any yet; ſo that there was a neceſſity of taking the place, or hazarding a ſharp conflict. The <hi>Sieur de Thoyras</hi> had divers conjectures of his deſign, and that he might put himſelf into a condition of defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding himſelf he ſent advice to the Fort <hi>de la Pree,</hi> deſiring them to have their For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in a readineſſe, to aſſiſt him, when he ſhould diſcharge three Canon ſhot, for a ſign that the enemy began their aſſault. Preſently hereupon, the <hi>Sieur de Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naples</hi> called the Officers together, to conſult of what was proper to be done, and it was unanimouſly concluded, that all their Forces ſhould be put into Battalia by break of day: That they ſhould march towards <hi>Abbay,</hi> and that upon hearing of the Signal, they ſhould go directly to the enemy to divert them from the Aſſault. This Order was exerciſed accordingly, and they were no ſooner drawn up toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:56802:100"/>but the Cannons gave them notice of the aſſault: the <hi>Sieur de Canaples</hi> went directly towards the Cittadel. It is reported, that there were between four and five thouſand Engliſh at the aſſault: However, they made but two conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable attempts, one upon the <hi>Baſtion de Thoyras,</hi> which was not quite finiſhed; they got up upon the Rampars, but were ſo ill treated by the Beſieged, that they were forced to give back, and to make ſuch haſt down their Ladders, that ſome of them never touched but the laſt round. The t'other Attempt was at the <hi>Baſtion Antioch,</hi> where the Engliſh had no better ſucceſſe, for many of them were killed with Musket ſhot, Stones, and long Staffs which were in the Half Moon, ſo they fled and were purſued home to their Trenches.

The two Armies lay in view of each other, the reſt of the day, without doing any thing, and night comming on, they of the Kings party, withdrew to <hi>Pree.</hi> In the mean while, the <hi>Sieur de Canaples</hi> unwilling as hath been ſaid to attempt any thing, was inform'd how the beſieged had taken all the Ladders of the Engliſh, fifty Priſoners, moſt of which were Captains and Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, that they had killed between five and ſix hundred, without loſing above eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen or twenty men, and ſome few wounded, amongſt which were the <hi>Sieurs de Sardaignes</hi> and <hi>Gran Val,</hi> who being ſhot through the Bodies died in a few dayes after. This Victory did much rejoyce the Kings Army, and his Majeſty himſelf too, who was diligently informed of it.

                  <p>TWo things are chiefly neceſſary for the repelling of an aſſault, men and fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations. It cannot be denied but that fortifications are needfull; for it were a vanity to beleeve, that a few men blocked up in a place, ſhould be able to reſiſt a whole Army, if they be not defended with <hi>Baſtions,</hi> half Moons, and other Forts raiſed up to a ſufficient height to protect them, whence it follows, that his chief care who doth command a place when he fore-ſees an aſſault, ought to be, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide his fortifications, that they bee in a condition proper for it, and that hee have preparations in a readineſſe to repair the breaches. He will find it too no ſmall advantage againſt his enemies, ſince it is much eaſier to repulſe an enemy, who attempts to enter a place by Scaling-Ladders, then if there were a Breach where many might come in a Breaſt, or his Fortifications ſhould be in want of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair. But whatever advantage it is to have good and ſtrong Fortifications, yet the valour of the Souldiers, is that which is moſt of all conſiderable. What ſaid <hi>Pompey?</hi> It is not Walls or Houſes which makes Towns, but men, neither can they be defeated, be they what they will, without the help of men; we often ſee the very ſtrongeſt places ſoon delivered up, when not defended by men of heart and courage. <hi>Azarius</hi> being beſieged in <hi>Quiers,</hi> by <hi>Vaſtius,</hi> had indeed notable good Fortifications, and had alſo placed in the Breach, ſtore of combuſtible matter, with Fire-works, but all would not hinder the Town from being taken, for that no one man appeared to withſtand the Aſſault. <hi>Archimedes</hi> his Engines could not defend the loſſe of <hi>Syracuſa:</hi> Engines and Fortifications are all in animate, and their Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers are limited to certain effects, in deſpight of all which, a Beſieging Army, will ſoon take in any place, if there be not men of reſolution and courage to reſiſt their attempts. But that we may mention ſome order which Hiſtory teacheth in endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring a Siege, or ſuſtaining an Aſſault, it ought to be known, That he who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:56802:101"/>a place, muſt not then draw up his Souldiers, when the enemy appears at the Breach, or mount their Ladders; but he ought ſo to diſpoſe them into every Quarter how ſtrong ſoever it be, that no part be left without a ſufficient number of men to guard it. <hi>Caeſar</hi> when he committed this fault, by ſtaying untill <hi>Pharnaces</hi> was at his Elbow, found himſelf much perplexed and troubled. <hi>Jugurtius</hi> as <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſt</hi> reporteth it, having been defective in this one point, gave <hi>Marius</hi> opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to become Maſter of one of his ſtrongeſt places. <hi>Thraſybulus</hi> took <hi>Sicyonian's</hi> Port, finding it dis-furniſhed of Souldiers, who were all gone to a certain Breach which he had made, and where he onely pretended he would aſſault them. <hi>Vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius?</hi> adviſeth, that the firſt aſſault be ſuſtained by the moſt experienced and ſtouteſt ſouldiers; becauſe an enemy when he meets with reſolute oppoſition, and finds himſelf ill handled, loſeth his Courage, and few have any mind to march over their Companions dead bodies unto a ſecond aſſault. But I ſhall refer the proſecution of this diſcourſe to them who have written whole Tracts upon it.</p>

                  <p>THE King having been informed of the good ſucceſſe in the late encounter, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched in great haſt the remayning four thouſand five hundred foot and Horſe, allotted out for the Relief with good ſtore of Munitions. It cannot be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed how careful his Majeſty was for the ſhipping off of them, how dilligent in chooſing the Officers and Souldiers one by one; animating by his preſence thoſe who carried the proviſions into the Ships, and incouraging thoſe who went aboard on this expedition; telling them, they might be confident of victory, ſeeing they fought for God's cauſe. The Marſhal <hi>de Schomberg</hi> was appointed Marſhal <hi>de Camp.</hi> The wind changing about juſt as they were put off to Sea, they were forced to give back again, ſome one way, ſome another; But the <hi>Marillac</hi> came at laſt to the point of <hi>Sablanceau</hi> without being hindred by the Enemy, and paſſed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out difficulty to the Fort <hi>De La Pree:</hi> and the next day the Marſhal <hi>de Schomberg</hi> came with fifty Barques about three in the morn being the eight day of <hi>Novem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</hi> He Landed very fortunately being not diſcovered by the Enemy, and his Souldiers being all upon the ſhore, he forthwith ranged them into four Battali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and his Horſe likewiſe into four Squadrons, which he extended into two wings, and in this order they marched up to the Fort. About day break they came up, where he found all the Forces which had formerly been ſent thither draw into order, according as he had inſtructed <hi>Marillac.</hi> When he had been informed of what had paſſed, he ſent out to diſcover the enemy, and put all things in order to fight. But firſt he would hear Maſſe, that he might implore Gods aſſiſtance, without which, there is no hopes of good ſucceſs, as alſo he cauſed the general Prayers to be made, which are uſed in all Battailes.</p>
                  <p>Then he cauſed his Souldiers to eat, that they might be ſtrong, at which time, he was informed that the enemy had drawn part of their Forces, out of their Trenches and made as if they would retreit, whereupon he concluded there was no more time to be loſt. So he reviewed the Army, to ſee if every one were in readineſs, and then marched upon the head of them, toward St. <hi>Martin.</hi> The <hi>Sieur de Thoyras</hi> came out to meet him, with as much joy as a perſon delivered from ſuch eminent peril could expreſſe, for the Enemy had forſaken their Trenches and left him the liberty of comming forth. The Marſhal having likewiſe intelligence, that the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my had quited the Town of St. <hi>Martin,</hi> preſently called a Counſel of war, to conſider of what was fit to be done. The <hi>Sieur de Thoyras</hi> propoſed to march up directly to them, being confident, that in the fear they were, it would be eaſie to cut them in pieces; The <hi>Sieur de Marillac,</hi> was of a contrary opinion, thinking that nothing ought to be hazarded, ſeeing the ſucceſſe of Arms is uncertain, That his Majeſties Army was not ſure of a victorie againſt the Enemy, though they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treited, and concluded it improper to fight with them. But the buſineſs having been debated, it was reſolved that a <hi>Medium</hi> ſhould be taken, that without quitting
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:56802:101"/>the Station they had taken, the Motion of the Enemy ſhould be obſerved; and that in caſe they ſhould paſſe unto the Ile <hi>d'Oye,</hi> (where it was not unknown that they had prepared a Paſſage for their re-imbarquing) then to follow them in order of Array, and charge them when they were half over, but without putting any thing in hazard.</p>
                  <p>This reſolution accompanied with prudence, was excecuted with Courage, for the Engliſh advancing towards the place of their retreit; the Kings Army marcht up to them in Battalia, and being arrived to the Marſh, The <hi>Sieur de Thoyras</hi> could no longer ſuffer them to go away, without paying for the trouble, which they had put him to; but concluding that the Honour of <hi>France</hi> obliged him to have a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting bout with them, and that it would be a wrong to the Kings Arms to let them go clear off when ſuch an advantage was offered againſt them, went on, and the Command being given, the Horſe had order to begin. <hi>Piedmont</hi> and <hi>Champain</hi> followed, and each of them obſerving their reſpective Commands, put the Engliſh to the Rout: Their Horſe were all loſt in the ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

It is reported that the Engliſh had at their firſt ſetting foot on the <hi>Iſland</hi> at leaſt ſeven thouſand men, and that a recruit of three thouſand came afterwards to them, but they carried off only eighteen hundred, the reſt being either dead with ſickneſs or killed, and of them too the greateſt part dyed ſoon after their return to <hi>England,</hi> by reaſon of the diſcommodities they there ſuffered.</p>

                  <p>AFter the King had obtained this ſignal victory againſt the Engliſh, he bent all his thoughts towards the beſiedging of <hi>Rochel,</hi> that with their Wals he might deſtroy their pride. This town as others, was at firſt but little, yet the Port being commodious, it grew great by Commerce, and ſo inſolent after hereſie had ſet its ſtandard there, that they would make thoſe priviledges, which our Kings had from time to time granted them, paſſe for contracts, and to deſtabliſh a kind of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth in the State. They durſt not openly declare this pretention to the King by their Deputies, but their manner of proceeding was an aſſured proof of it, a procedure the more inſupportable in that it was the ſupport of all factions, both of the Hugonot party and the Grandees of the Kingdome upon any diſcontents. Their Rebellion was become natural, and ſhortly after this, they auguented their Crimes, by calling in the Engliſh to protect their offences. Some rich Merchants indeed there were who having ſomewhat to looſe, would have been contented to be quiet, but on the otherſide it was filled with ſtore of Sea men ſurely and proud, as alſo very poor, who having nothing wherein to employ themſelves, propoſed, that they might be at more eaſe to make an inſurrection in the Town, concerning their priviledges. In order to this deſign, they made a Manifeſt, to ſpread abroad their complaints, as a poyſon in the minds of the Ignorant People of the Hugonots party, which might induce them to take up Arms, and to ſhake of the yoak of obedience. This reſolution of theirs took them off, from paying any reſpect to the King; They drove out the <hi>Sieur Doux Maiſtre des Requeſts,</hi> ſent by his Majeſty to them, in quality of ſuper intendent of Juſtice, with ſo much violence and outrage, that they threatned to throw him into the Sea.</p>
                  <p>They openly aſſiſted the Engliſh in whatever was within their power, They ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly buried the Engliſh Lords and Gentlemen, and ſuch French Rebels as were killed at the Landing on <hi>Ree.</hi> They ſent <hi>Londriere</hi> with three hundred men to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond the Engliſh, when they found themſelves too weak in <hi>Ree.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>They received <hi>Madam de Rohan</hi> the Mother, and the <hi>Sieur de Soubize;</hi> who aſſiſted at their aſſemblies and enflamed them more and more. There was no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon longer to ſuffer theſe things unpuniſhed. The King about the beginning of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> when they declared themſelves ſo openly for the Engliſh, made his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches upon the Town, ſeveral companies of the Regiment of the guard, with two other Regiments and two hundred Horſe, were ſent before it. The Duke <hi>d'Angouleſme</hi> began to work upon the Fort <hi>De La Moulinette</hi> to lodge Forces there, as well as in that of Fort <hi>Lewis.</hi> They requeſted the <hi>Sieur de Commings</hi> Captain of the Regiment of the guard, that he would come to their aſſembly to adviſe upon ſome means of accommodation; and as they ſaw no Declaration of an abſolute ſiege, until the Engliſh were forced from <hi>Ree,</hi> they thought to be excuſed as heretofore by renewing their Proteſtations of fidelily: But their words were not to be believed. All their propoſals tended onely to comfirm their reſolutions againſt the King. His Majeſty thereupon, after the defeat of the Engliſh, took his laſt reſolution of forcing them to acknowledge their faults, and to live within their bounds by a ſtrong ſiege. The Order of the whole circumvallation was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by his Majeſty; he raiſed 13 Forts and ſeveral redoubts upon the Trenches the circuit of which were three Leagues or there about, all out of muſquet or fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con ſhot, but not of Cannon. The Kings deſign was by making theſe works, to
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:56802:103"/>compel them by famine and neceſſity to ſurrender, neither did they much trouble themſelves to hinder their work by their Sallies, upon hope of being eaſily relee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by Sea; forſomuch as they were ſoon, finiſhed by the care of the Cardinal, and the Marſhals <hi>de Scomberg,</hi> and <hi>Baſſompierre.</hi> His Majeſty being well aſſured of their faithfulneſſe, would not imploy any other perſons indifferently, as former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly had been done in <hi>Charles</hi> the ninth's time, and that ſo inconſiderately, that the very Commanders of the Siege had no deſire to take the Town. This circumral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation thus finiſhed, cut off all releef by Land, and it happened that having ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Engliſh with a good part of their provſions, they had been quickly brought by neceſſity to ſurrender, had they not been aſſiſted by Sea.

The Cardinal acquainted the King with the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of it, and thoſe contrivances formerly reſolved on for that purpoſe were put in execution. The Cardinal had the Chief conduct of it, becauſe he had exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined with an extraordinary care all the means of finiſhing the ſiege with good ſucceſſe, and was more capable than any other to effect it. He was ſo modeſt that he ſuffered himſelf to be directed by <hi>Pomp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

Targon</hi> an <hi>Italian</hi> Ingineer, who had wrought with the Spaniards in blocking up the Channel of <hi>Oſtende,</hi> he thought good to make a chaine of Maſts and other great pieces linked together, with Harping Irons and Cables, but the firſt ſhot forced them in ſunder, and ſpoiled the work. He built certain Caſtles upon Ships ſome floating, and ſome fixed in the Sea. He contrived other engines which were Square, and of great pieces of timber, ſuch as he called Bridges, for the planting of Cannon upon them, le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled juſt between wind and water. But all theſe inventions were more for ſhew than uſe, though very chargeable, ſo the Cardinal was forced to follow his own thoughts and the deſign which himſelf had contrived for ſtopping the paſſage: and as there is no ſoul like his, ſo no invention could equal that, whic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> himſelf had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected. It was to raiſe a certain banck, thwart the <hi>Channel,</hi> leaving onely an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance in the middle for the ebbing of the Sea. This deſign ſeemed difficult for that the Sea is uncapable of any obſtacles, which humane induſtry can raiſe againſt it. But as the ſtarres obey great Souls, ſo it was unjuſt that the Elements ſhould reſiſt his will. Two things induced him to judge, that this banck would eaſlier be raiſed than divers imagined. Firſt, the advantage of ſtones which might be had on both ſides of the <hi>Channel,</hi> and the great multitude of labourers, which might be drawn out of the bordering Countries and from the Army it ſelf for a quick diſpatch of the work. It was began in a place where the River is ſeven hundred and forty fathom broad, where the Cannon of <hi>Rochel</hi> could not reach but at random, ſo that the work could not be hindred. The Cardinal allowed 12 fathom of depth, which quickly paſſing over, they left a ſtoping in the bottome, and made a plat form of four fathome upon the ſurface, which ſhould be raiſed to ſuch an height, that the higheſt tyde could not reach it. It was built of dry ſtones laid upon one another, without other morter than what the Sea brought, and to ſtrengthen it the better at every 12 foot, there was an addition of great timber.</p>

It was ſo advanced in two moneths time, that the <hi>Rochelois</hi> who had hoped that it would onely ſerve for a laughing-ſtock to the Ocean, could now onely at ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral times paſſe four or five ſmall Veſſels over it. However, it was a vaſt work ſuch as paſſed beleef, neither was it finiſhed, till 7 or 8 moneths were ended. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides this, the paſſages in the middle, for the ebbing of the Sea, was to be ſtopped up, to hinder the going in or out of any Veſſels. Three great Fences were found out, ſuch as could not be bettered. The firſt was a Range of about 40 Veſſels fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with Stones and ſunk to the bottome. The ſecond was a kind of Palliſado made about as many floating Veſſels linked together with Chains and Cables, which were guarded by a whole Regiment. The third was of great ſtakes, faſtned in the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome of the Sea, made Taper waies which for that reaſon were called <hi>Chandelie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>IT of ſo great importance to hinder the comming in of Proviſion to beſieged Towns that that being once ſecured the taking of them cannot be avoided, &amp; they who have forced them by famine, have by the Ancients been more honoured then thoſe who have taken them by the ſword, becauſe they are leſt ſubject to hazards, and their Souldiers lives not in danger. A thing very conſiderable. In long ſieges the onely thing intended, is by neceſſity to force the beſieged to open their Gates; the truth is, moſt commonly this is a work of time, and conſequently of great expence; but on the other ſide, it ſaves a great many Souldiers lives, which is a recompence great enough. It was one of <hi>Caeſars</hi> advices, in forcing of Towns rather to do it by Famine then the Sword, as the Phyſitian ſaveth his Patients more by abſtinence then forcible Medicines. The truth is, I imagine this to be the better and ſafer way, in regard neceſſity is ſuch a thing, as nothing whatever can reſiſt. Now as it is a way very advantagious, ſo is not leſſe difficult, eſpecially in Sea Towns, here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore eſteemed impregnable becauſe of the incertainty of the Sea, and weather, which ſeldome lets a Fleet lie long in ſafety, to prevent relief, as alſo by reaſon of its violence, which commonly laughs at all thoſe inventions contrived to ſtop up a Port or Haven: Though this latter opinion, is at preſent but weak and frivolous, ſeeing men have by induſtry found out ſeveral means to overcome all manner of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacles of this nature. <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great beſieged the City of <hi>Tyre,</hi> ſtopped up the Channel by a Bank, took away all hopes of relief, and at laſt forced them to ſurrender to his mercy, after they had refuſed to deliver up upon fair and honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable terms. <hi>Caeſar</hi> did the like before <hi>Duras;</hi> as alſo <hi>St. Lewis</hi> upon the <hi>R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

                     <pb n="197" facs="tcp:56802:104"/>Upon theſe four points it was, that he gave the <hi>Sieur de Macheville</hi> inſtructions to treat with them. As to the firſt, he was forbidden to thwart the Emperours de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign. His Majeſty not thinking it fit to declare himſelf againſt the Emperour, to the end he might have more power and freedome towards the ſetling of his own affairs. But he was commanded to flatter the Duke of <hi>Bavian</hi> upon that accompt and dexterouſly to humour him, in his imaginary hopes of the Empire, by repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting to him, as likewiſe unto the reſt of the Electors, That it would very much concern them to promote ſome ſubject of leſſe greatneſs then thoſe of the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> unto that dignity, by which means the head of the Empire having a nearer equality and correſpondency with the reſt of the Members, their union would bee the ſtronger, and their conditions the more ſecure. And in caſe he ſhould find the Electors averſe from that Propoſal, he was then commanded quaintly to hint unto them, but not too openly; that the Emperour not being troubled by Age, or Sickneſſe, it would not be amiſſe to defer their Election of the Roman King unto ſome other time, ſeeing by this delay they would render themſelves the more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable towards the Princes of <hi>Germany,</hi> and the Emperour himſelf who would be the more carefull to preſerve their friendſhip, it being ſo conducing to his deſign; whereas having attained his ends, and finding himſelf in a condition of being no more beholding to them, neither for himſelf or his, it was to be feared leaſt hee ſhould indeavour to extend the limits of his Ambition to their prejudice. This was he expreſly charged not openly to declare, becauſe the King thought it more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, to inſinnuate into the minds of thoſe Princes, the reſolution of excluding the King of <hi>Hungary</hi> from the Empire, or at leaſt to defer his Election, rather then to diſcover himſelf. However he was commanded to adviſe them, in caſe they were peremptorily reſolved to chuſe him, that it would concern them to take advantage of this affair, in which the Emperour was neceſſited to make uſe of them, that they might draw him to condiſcend unto ſuch conditions as might ſettle a firm Peace in the Empire, which it would concern them to do before the Election, leaſt he might be the more averſe to peace, when he ſhould find the Empire once aſſured upon his Son.</p>
                  <p>As to the ſecond particular, which relateth unto the Palatins retreat unto this Kingdome, he was commanded to tell thoſe Princes, that his Majeſty, could not aſſent unto it, whatever propoſals they made, of entertaining him at their Coſts and Charges; His reaſons were theſe, That it was not beſeeming the Dignity of a King to capiticlate concerning the Penſion of any Prince, unto whom his Majeſty pretended to be a refuge; and likewiſe that there was no reaſon, why he ſhould draw upon himſelf ſo great a Charge, not being neceſſitated thereunto; and in caſe they ſhould offer to pay all his Penſion without any treaty, he was then com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded freely to reply unto them, that their Promiſes did not at all make ſure the Penſion, and if it ſhould chance not to be paid his Majeſty could not then avoid the entertaining both of him, and his whole family. Beſides if the young Prince ſhould come into <hi>France,</hi> his Majeſty was in Honour bound, never to conſent unto the Peace of <hi>Germany</hi> until he were reſtored unto his States, and that he could not give him a Retreat, without promiſing to protect him, which he knew would not ſort with their Intereſts. That which concerned the Elector of <hi>Treves</hi> was not ſo diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult, ſeeing there wanted nothing but the aſſuring him of his Majeſties affection and good Will. He went accompanied with that which gave him a very particular ſatisfaction; but the ſecret management of it, being of great conſequence that he might ſerve his Majeſty without ſuſpition, the knowledg of this hath not been diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered unto any one but themſelves. As to the fourth and laſt which concerneth the Peace, at leaſt a Ceſſation of Arms, it was in relation to the enterprizes of the King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> and the Princes of the Lower <hi>Saxony,</hi> which had but ill ſucceſſe; ſo that he had Order to negotiate it the more effectually, not onely becauſe his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty was deſirous to give a period unto thoſe calamities, which had brought <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many</hi> into ſo miſerable a condition, but alſo for the Intereſts of this Crown, which being concern'd with thoſe Chriſtian Princes who are not tied to the Houſe of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtria,</hi>
                     <pb n="198" facs="tcp:56802:105"/>oblige him to hinder the Emperours becomming abſolute unto which the war ſeemed to contribute, by weakning the Princes Electors, and ruining the Proteſtants. This was the more conſiderable, in regard his Majeſty, was not then in a Capacity to redreſſe their aggrievances by force of Arms; he was likewiſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to procure an Electoral Diet where the Electours comming to treat toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, would doubtleſſe reſolve and conclude a Peace; whereas if they ſhould ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage their affairs by their Doctors, who for the moſt part were Penſioners to the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> there could be but ſlender hopes of a good ſucceſſe. His In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions Charged him, to acquaint them, that he was commanded to negotiate the ceſſation of Arms, both with the Emperour, the King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and that he ſhould effectually endeavour to accompliſh it, provided that they would, ingage unto his Majeſty, by Inſtruments drawn up in form, that they would, after the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> ſhould aſſent unto it, procure the Emperour to do the like, and that themſelves would do the ſame on their parts, and laſtly that they would call an Electoral Diet, where the Peace ſhould be ratified as alſo a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of their Alliance with <hi>France.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe were the Chief Points of the <hi>Sieur de Macheville</hi> Inſtructions; in which he beſtirred himſelf with ſuch diligence, that he prevailed upon the Princes Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors (without diſcovering his Majeſties Intentions) to defer the Election of the Roman King, That he perſwaded them to think it improper for the Prince Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor to retier into <hi>France;</hi> That he tied the Prince Elector of <hi>Treves</hi> unto his Majeſties Intereſts, by Chains of Gold, and that he at laſt procured them to meet at <hi>Mulhauſen.</hi> He himſelf came thither, and repreſented to them, thoſe great miſeries which the war had brought upon <hi>Germany,</hi> in ſuch effectual language, that they became more inclined to Peace, then formerly they had been.

                  <p>IT is a piece of great Prudence in a Prince to procure a Peace for his Allyes, when the war is not favourable to them. It cannot be doubted but that his endeavours will redound to his Honour and Glory, ſeeing it is no ſmall reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to become an Arbitrator between Soveraigns, for God himſelf, who overuleth the whole World hath ſtyled himſelf, The God of Peace. But beſides this conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, thoſe Princes who have gone by the worſt in a war, are mutually bound to aſſiſt him, in his occaſions, he having preſerved them from deſtruction, withal the quality of Allie doth oblige him to become a Mediator for them, it being a means proper to preſerve their Union, and an Act neceſſary for their conſervation. The Laws of Charity which command all Chriſtians to lend a helping hand unto one another in dangers and neceſſities, do more eſpecially injoyn it unto Princes ſeeing their downfals cannot but carry greater conſequences with them, and that after many frowns of war, their ruin cannot be avoided. When once they are reduced to extremity, it is no longer ſeaſonable then to treat of a Peace; for victory pufs up their Enemy whoſe inſolency will hardly give way, to looſe the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages he hath gotten; and if he ſhould be drawn to lay down his Arms, it muſt be upon hard and ſhameful termes. It is eaſie to conceive, how dangerous it is, long to expoſe them unto the uncertainties of war, ſeeing that Prince: who once looſes either part of his reputation or forces, doth for the moſt part undergo duly croſſes, and ſeems to have been made the laughing ſtock of Fortune. It was not without great reaſon, that <hi>Scipio</hi> ſaid unto <hi>Antiochus,</hi> The Majeſty of a King is not ſo eaſily reduced from the height of their power, to a more indifferent degree, as it is precipitated from an indifferent degree, unto the loweſt ebb of Fortune. Hereupon it was that <hi>Hannibal</hi> deſired Peace of <hi>Scipio,</hi> the <hi>African</hi> before the laſt battail which he fought, in which he was overcome; and that he <hi>Etolians</hi> were blamed for not accepting of it, when offered unto them, by the Romans, after
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:56802:105"/>they had been often worſted by them. I might hereunto add, that a King who in ſuch occaſions procureth a Peace, for this Allyes, doth not a little ſerve his own Intereſts, for that a Kings Power conſiſteth as much in the force of his Allyes, as in that of his own ſubjects. There is ſo ſtrict an Union between the States of Allyes, that no one of them can receive any conſiderable loſſe, but the effects of it will ſoon appear in all the reſt. The Power of Allyes is like the ſtrength of the Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers to a Kingdome, and as an Enemy, having once gotten the ſuburbs and out Quarters, hath a notable advantage againſt the Town, it ſelf, ſo the Allyes of a King can neither be weakned nor ruined, but himſelf is in danger of being aſſaulted in his own Dominions, and is rendred the leſſe able to make reſiſtance in regard his Allyes are not in a condition to relieve him. It was for this cauſe that <hi>Thucydides</hi> ſaid, he who diſ-reſpecteth his dangers of his Allyes, is careleſſe of his own ſafety, and I conceive, that a Prince who ſees his Allyes groaning under the hand of War, is equally bound to aſſiſt them, by mediating a Peace for them, leaſt his ruin follow theirs as every man ſeeing his Neighbours houſe on fire, is obliged to uſe his utmoſt endeavour to extinguiſh it, leaſt his own houſe come into the like danger.</p>

He diſcovered to him the great deſire he had for the diſſolution of his marriage, that he might afterwards wed, not one of the Emperours daughters as was ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, but the Princeſſe <hi>Maria</hi> his Neece, whom he paſſionately loved, and from whom he had great hopes of having a Son who might ſucceed after him. As to that which concerned the Prince <hi>de Rethelois,</hi> he ever ſpoke of him with great reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, as a Prince whom he loved and eſteemed, and whom he looked on as his ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor, in caſe he died without iſſue. The Marqueſs <hi>de Saint Chaumont,</hi> thought it improper to propoſe to him, when he found him ſo inclined, the marrying of the Princeſſe <hi>Maria</hi> to the Duke <hi>de Rethelois,</hi> it being an unſeaſonable motion to one who earneſtly deſired her for himſelf: But talking in private with the Marqueſſe <hi>de Strigio,</hi> chief Miniſter of <hi>Mantoua,</hi> he diſcovered it to him, and ingaged him to contribute his aſſiſtance to it, in caſe a diſſolution of his preſent contract could not be obtained, as the onely and principal means to preſerve his Maſters Life, giving him withal to obſerve that this once done, the houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> and Duke of <hi>Sax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ony</hi> muſt of neceſſity ceaſe their pretenſions, which whileſt the Duke was without a Succeſſor were too many, any longer to be permitted. He preſſed him too the more earneſtly, in regard, the Marqueſſe <hi>de Strigio</hi> told him, how that the Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians had aſſured that Duke <hi>Vincent</hi> could not long ſubſiſt, his body being ſickly. The Marqueſs <hi>de Strigio</hi> was ſenſible of the importance of that particular, and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully promiſed to uſe his utmoſt diligence and power to effect <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

As to the neutrality which the Duke was obliged by intereſt to obſerve between the two Crowns, the Duke would oftentimes tell the Marqueſſe that his heart was French, that he was totally diſpoſed to pay all reſpects and ſervices to his Majeſty which could be expected from him; and that by the natural inclination he had for <hi>France</hi> to be gratefull in acknowledging the protection which his Majeſty had given his late Brother <hi>Ferdinand;</hi> and he added that his Majeſty ſhould never have any cauſe to be offended with him. The Marqueſſe having thus diſpatched the greateſt part of his affair, took his leave of the Duke, to return to his Majeſty, and to give him an accompt of what he had done.</p>

Divers Princes have been ruined by their tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of injuries againſt thoſe who have depended on them.

Nothing is indeed more glorious to Kings, then the obſervation of this thing. It is an action reſembling the divinity, to protect the weak againſt the mighty, and to defend them from oppreſſion.

If this rule be worth conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration in general, it is much more to be obſerved in reſpect of the rights which may befall his Majeſties Subjects in <hi>Italy,</hi> where it is abſolutely neceſſary to prevent the increaſing greatneſſe of the houſe of <hi>Auſtria.</hi> They have already become Maſters of the greateſt part of <hi>Germany,</hi> and there is not any more certain way to ballance their growing power. then by Alliances with the Princes of <hi>Italy,</hi> by finding out ſome means to ſet foot in their Country, be it either by gaining ſome of their States, as divers of our late Kings have attempted, or by eſtabliſhing ſuch French in them, as want not pretences to them, and which might be able to let in the Arms of <hi>France,</hi> when the Princes of <hi>Italy</hi> ſhould have occaſion to make uſe of them, and there is no doubt, but the Princes of <hi>Italy</hi> would be very glad to ſee the Arms of our Kings in their Country, oppoſing thoſe of the Spaniard whom they hate becauſe they fear.

                  <p>UPon the news which his Majeſty recived by the Marqueſſe <hi>de St. Chaumont;</hi> that there was little hopes of Duke <hi>Vincents</hi> long life, he concluded it to be very neceſſary that he ſhould uſe his utmoſt indeavours to make up the Match, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Prince <hi>de Rethelois,</hi> and the Princeſſe <hi>Maria,</hi> as alſo to procure that he might be declared the Succeſſor to the States of <hi>Mantua</hi> and <hi>Montferrat,</hi> after the deceaſe of his Father the Duke <hi>de Nevers.</hi> The Cardinal by his Councels, ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Majeſties judgement, and that with the more eagerneſſe, in regard the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> and Governour of <hi>Milan,</hi> did both begin to declare their pretences. This made his Majeſty reſolve upon ſending away the Marqueſſe <hi>de Saint Chaumont</hi> into <hi>Italy.</hi> The Inſtruction which he received was onely of two particulars, in which he was to beſtir himſelf: The firſt was in his Majeſties name to make an end of thoſe differences between the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> and <hi>Mantua;</hi> to which end, he was to paſſe by <hi>Turin,</hi> to diſpoſe Duke <hi>Ferdinand</hi> to the making of ſome other overtures for their accommodation, and then to propoſe them to the Duke of <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tua,</hi> to ſee if any concluſion could be had; withal, to let them both know, that a good correſpondence were not amiſſe for the good of their States; in regard their enemies by their diviſions, would be furniſhed with opportunities to make attempts upon them: The ſecond was to labour very earneſtly with the Duke of <hi>Mantua,</hi> for the concluding of the Match between his Neece, and the Prince <hi>de Rethelois,</hi> and that he might be declared ſucceſſor to his States, after the deceaſe of his Father the Duke of <hi>Nevers.</hi> At that preſent it was the eaſier to be effected, in regard the
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:56802:107"/>Pope had ſolemnly proteſted he would never grant a diſpenſation of his firſt mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage. He was alſo commanded to ſhew unto him, that as this marriage was of great advantage and benefit to the Duke of <hi>Nevers,</hi> and <hi>Rethelois</hi> whom he loved, by aſſuring them of the ſucceſſion, ſo it was not leſſe neceſſary to defend and ſecure himſelf from the attempts which the Spaniard, and Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> might make upon his life and State, for that they did already begin to diſcover their intentions againſt him. He was farther Commanded, That if Duke <hi>Vincent</hi> ſhould chance to die, whilſt he was near him, then to animate in his Majeſty name the Chief leading men of the States of <hi>Montua</hi> and <hi>Montferrat</hi> by all arguments of reaſon and perſwaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to preſerve the liberties of their Country, to keep the faith obedience which they did owe unto <hi>Monſieur de Nevers,</hi> as their Lawful Prince, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare him for ſucceſſour to Duke <hi>Vincent,</hi> according to the uſual Forms of thoſe Countries; and laſtly to aſſure them, that his Majeſty would protect them againſt any Forces that ſhould moleſt or trouble them, that himſelf would invite the Pope and all other Princes of <hi>Italy</hi> to joyne with them in defence of their liberties. Theſe were the Chief Inſtructions in the Marquis his Commiſſion.</p>
                  <p>In order to them, he went to the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> to perſwade him to ſome agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with <hi>Mounſieur de Mantua.</hi> He told him how the report went of his being in league with the Spaniards, for the deviding of <hi>Montferrat,</hi> But the Duke ſeemed to be angry at it, and wondred that after the having done ſuch good Offices to his Majeſty be ſhould imagine ſuch a thing of them. Yet he did not diſown his appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions of the advantage which he might now take during Duke <hi>Vincents</hi> ſickneſs, to regain that which did belong to him in <hi>Montferrat,</hi> adding withal, that it would be much more for his Majeſties Intereſt, if it were is his hands rather then the Spaniards, and that at laſt in caſe he were joyned with the Spaniards, yet it was no more then his Majeſty himſelf had done, ſeeing they ſent him a Fleet to <hi>Rochel;</hi> But the <hi>Marquis</hi> that he might lay the foundation of an agreement, propoſed to him, to renew the Treaty which had been between the late Duke <hi>Ferdinand</hi> and himſelf, as to that which was in diſpute between them, in <hi>Montferrat:</hi> all the anſwer he could get was this, he demanded fifteen thouſand Crowns rent, for his pretentions there, and twenty thouſand for the Damages he had ſuſtained for want of executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his promiſes made of marrying his little Daughter with the Cardinal his Son: By theſe his unreaſonable demands he evidenced that he only ſought an occaſion to juſtifie his breach with him; and the <hi>Marquis</hi> finding after divers other confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences had with him, that there was no good to be done, made no longer ſtay there, but went to <hi>Mantua,</hi> he came thither ſo opportunely, as if Fortune had lead him by the hand, for within five dayes after his arrival there, the Duke dyed. He found that the <hi>Marquis de Strigio</hi> had diſpoſed the Duke, with a great deal of addreſſe to all that could be deſired, That he had ſtirred him up, on the deſigns which his Enemies might ſet on foot both againſt his life and State, to declare by his Letters Patents, the Duke <hi>de Nevers</hi> his only and Lawful ſucceſſour, in all his States, and the Duke <hi>de Rethelois</hi> his Livetenant General, ordering him to marry his Niece the Princeſſe <hi>Marie</hi> before his deceaſe, and to cauſe the Governours of all ſtrong places faithfully to keep them for the Duke <hi>de Nevers.</hi> There wanted indeed a diſpenſe for the marriage, but the Duke ſent in all haſt to demand it of his Holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; When the <hi>Marquis de Chaumont</hi> came thither. It was not as yet arrived, but hourly expected, and though it was not brought but only a very few minuts before his death, yet the <hi>Marquis of Strigio</hi> who knew how neceſſary it was for the State of affairs, told the Prince <hi>de Rethelois</hi> and the Princeſs <hi>Maria,</hi> that they muſt forthwith marry, or elſe be aſſured never to enjoy the States of <hi>Mantua.</hi> It was a bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs of ſo great importance, that it would admit of no longer conſultation, ſo that it was concluded, and married they were about nine in the night, on Chriſtmaſſe Eve; the marriage was conſummated, and not long after the news of Duke <hi>Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cents</hi> death was brought unto them. This accident was of very great concern to the Duke <hi>de Nevers.</hi> Who without it, might perchance never have enjoyned the Dukedom of <hi>Mantua.</hi> At that preſent he was in <hi>France,</hi> but hearing of it, he
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:56802:107"/>took poſt and about the end of <hi>January</hi> came to <hi>Mantua,</hi> where finding all things according to his own deſire, he took proffeſſion of the State, and the <hi>Marquis de Chaumont</hi> return'd back to <hi>France.</hi> He paſſed by <hi>Thurin,</hi> and uſed new endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to perſwade the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> to an accommodation, but it would not be: yet he ſerved the King in this occaſion, by withdrawing divers of the Nobility of Dauphine, from the Duke of <hi>Savoy's</hi> Army, who had ingaged themſelves with him, not knowing his deſign was upon <hi>Montferrat</hi> which the Duke hearing of, was much offended, and told him, it would not be ſafe for him to ſtay any longer in <hi>Turin.</hi>

If there be any perſon of quality of his party, he muſt court him with all kind of reſpects, for in Revolts, every one would be Maſter &amp; Command.

Their fury is like that of Sea, they are only guided by the Inconſtancy of the winds.

                  <p>IN Publique exhortations, Prudence is many times as effectual, as Force. But for the ſafty of Towns, the Inhabitants ought to be prevented, their Arms taken away, and the moſt Factious amongſt them, turned out from them. To prevent them, is of great conſequence they being like the Camileon, which taketh any colour, that is laid before it. Sometimes a very little matter will ſettle them, if applied in time, and before Faction hath got any great power in their minds. One man well prepared and eſteemed by them may eaſily ſtop their violent proceedings by laying the miſeries which follow war before them; by acquainting them with their own weakneſſes, and by aſſuring them of enjoying their goods in Liberty and Peace. A mutinous people may at firſt be wrought upon by their own Intereſts, the Rule by which they Judg of all things. For they naturally think well of nothing but what pleaſeth them, and reject that for evil which putteth them to any pains or trouble. To believe their promiſes and not diſarm them were a madneſs; ſeeing they never hold long in the ſame humour; the leaſt ſhew of liberty charmeth them: They are alwayes Enemies of the preſent State of Affairs: Lovers of Novel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; moved with any winds nay thoſe of their own raiſing: They do more affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately embrance thoſe things which are prohibited, then thoſe which are permitted them: Great friends they are to innovations: Infidellity is a Quality which they eat and drink, not to be ſeperated from them: inſomuch that to leave them armed, when a revolt is miſtruſted were to permit a Sword in a mad mans hand. The ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending and ſecuring of ſeditious perſons, is the next thing conſiderable, which ought eſpecially to be done. A diſcreet Phiſician, doth make it his firſt work to draw out all the ill humours from his Patients body, which ſerve to nouriſh his Fever: and the firſt thing which a Miniſter is bound to obſerve, in a place where Rebellion is like to break out, is to withdraw all ſuch diſcontented, mutinous and Factious perſons as are any way likely to carry the people to revolt.</p>
                  <p>That rigor which is uſed to ſuch perſons ought to be eſteemed as a Commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:56802:109"/>Pitty. If they ſhould complain of their condition, it is much better, to ſuffer the Inſolencies of their words in a place, where they cannot do any hurt, then to run the hazard of their mutinous Actions in a City which they may probably cauſe to revolt.</p>

                  <p>There was likewiſe another little Town not far off Saint <hi>Aubin,</hi> which did much infeſt thoſe parts, the Prince ſurrounded it, took it by ſtorm, and put all the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers in it to the Sword.

                  <p>TRue Religion giveth a very great advantage to them, who fight for the defence of it. He hath Juſtice for his ſecond, which is the Bulwark of ſtrong place, the Rampard of Towns, the upholder of Crowns, the Pillar of Authority and the Chain of obedience; an Engine it is, much ſtronger then any of <hi>Archimedes</hi> ſeeing it brings down God himſelf upon Earth to aſſiſt it.

                  <p>In the old Teſtament he cauſeth himſelf to be called the God of Battails, and the Lord of Hoſts, to teach the people, that he is Maſter of them; and that he it is who turneth the victory where he pleaſeth. What did ever the greateſt Souldiers bring to paſſe, who have riſen up againſt him? They have only felt his power, and ſeen their own weakneſs: And every one may obſerve in Hiſtory that their Counſels have not only been vain and ridiculous, but have likewiſe precipitated them into great ruins: They are like <hi>Icarus,</hi> who deſigning to counterfeit wings, by joyning certain Fethers together with wax, melted them at the Sun Beams; juſt thus their riſing up and ſoaring a loſt, only ſerveth to make their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

The Souldier who fighteth for Religion, obeyeth his Prince, as the Image of the God head; he will never ſpare this life, which paſſeth away, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence of another which ſhall be eternal. If the Champions who heretofore fought in the <hi>Olympique Games,</hi> were delighted to ſee their skins flayed off, their bloud run down, and their bones broken before a Laurel Crown, the reward of their pains, what would they not have done, into with dangers would they not have cheerfully run, had they but apprehended with the Eyes of faith, the Saviour of the World, at the end of the courſe, the Gate of Heaven open, and a Crown which ſhall never fade, as a reward of their Loyalty and Vallour?

In order to which hope, they finding his Majeſties re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to force them to live in the rules of obedience, had ſent their Deputies to <hi>England,</hi> with full and ample Power, to treat with his Majeſty of Great <hi>Brittain,</hi> To beſeech him to take them into his protection, and that he would aſſiſt them, with a ſecond Army which might force the King of <hi>France,</hi> to raiſe the ſiedge. Their Deputies were received, with great kindneſs; The King of <hi>Buckingham</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing much exaſperated againſt <hi>France,</hi> for the late repulſe given to the Engliſh at <hi>Ree.</hi> They had audience granted, and after examination of their Propoſals, The King made a Treaty with them, by which he obliged himſelf to aſſiſt them with ſuch a number of Souldiers as ſhould be ſufficient for their defence; To ſend them all ſorts of Proviſion; and to permit a Collection to be made in his Countries for their preſent relief. The Deputies obliged themſelf in the name of the <hi>Rochelois</hi> to give an happy ſucceſſe to the Engliſh Army, promiſing they would rigg out the greateſt number of Ships they could poſſibly procure, that they would provide Pilats and places for Magazins for all ſorts of proviſion in the Town; that if occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion were their Port ſhould be a place of retreat for their Fleet; that they would not hearken to any accomodation with the King their Lord and Maſter, but by and with conſent of the King of great <hi>Brittain,</hi> and alſo that before <hi>France</hi> ſhould at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt any thing againſt <hi>England,</hi> they ſhould declare themſelves for the Engliſh, and ſhould divert to the utmoſt of the power, all deſigns tending to their preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice. The King of Great <hi>Brittain</hi> was not abſolute enough to conclude upon great enterpriſes, his power ſomewhat depending on the Parliament, ſo he was forced to call one to authorize this, and to conſent to ſuch levies of mony as would be need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for this buſineſs; The anger which every one there bore againſt <hi>France,</hi> and the deſire of revenging the affront which they had ſo lately received, perſwaded them to a general conſent. They wanted onely the third Vote, upon which the Levy depended, where upon they refuſed to contribute any money, colouring their denial by diverſe complaints, which they made againſt the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> and moſt part of the Chief Miniſters in <hi>England,</hi> which made a great noiſe in the Parliament, and ſo incenſed the King, that being conſtrained to give way to the inſolence of their requeſts, he told them that he would examine their demands and complaints, and give them anſwer accordingly; However be gave order for the rigging out of a ſtrong Fleet in behalf of the <hi>Rochelois,</hi> and gave the command of it to the Earle of <hi>Denbigh</hi> the Duke of <hi>Buckingham's</hi> brother in Law. This was all the <hi>Rochelois</hi> could hope for, yet it blinded them to all reſpect and obedience, They ſhaked off the yoak of Loyalty which they owed to the King; they carried them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the utmoſt extremities that poſſibly could be imagined; they trod under foot the Kings Authority, and choſe him for their <hi>Protector,</hi> who was Declared Emeny of his Crown.</p>

                  <p>ALthough a People never hath any lawful reaſon to become, diſloyal to their Prince, or to caſt themſelves into the Arms of the Enemy of his Country; yet it is a thing eaſily reſolved on, when there are no other means to ſecure them from the fears which they apprehend, and which have engaged them in their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volts. In Philoſophy it is held for a Maxim, That granting one abſurdity, a thouſand others will follow by conſequence; It is no leſſe certain among <hi>Polititians,</hi> that a people carried into one fault, which is the taking up Arms againſt their Prince, will be expoſed to great extremities, and every day augment the number of their Crimes. Their Cuſtome is to promiſe to themſelves great matters, in deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate affairs from ſtrangers, and ſuch means as are without all apparence of reaſon, probable wayes, or ordinary inſtruments: They are great lovers of Novelties and with a little wind carried to extremities; and new thoughts, if they find their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer reſolutions and deſigns not come to the accompt they expected. They eaſily follow thoſe, who put them in hopes of liberty; If any ſeditious perſon in credit with them, do but tickle them in the eare, with telling them that they do not enjoy their full and perfect liberties under their lawful Prince, nothing is then more eaſily perſwaded then to revolt, nay to throw themſelves, into the Armes of their very worſt enemy, never conſidering whether the remedie be not worſe then the diſeaſe. Being once revolted they never return to their duties, but by force of Armes, and the fear they have of paying the puniſhments they have juſtly deſerved, inviteth them rather to run, and hazard, then that of confeſſing their errour, and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting. An Ancient Authour ſaid very wiſely when he likened them to day-labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, who are at every ones ſervice, that will make uſe of them; ready they are to ſubvert all things, not for the publique good, but in order to their own deſign, and under pretence of liberty.

                  <p>At laſt <hi>Don Frederick de Toledo</hi> High Admiral of <hi>Spain,</hi> after many delayes came about the end of <hi>December</hi> with his pretended Fleet to the Haven of <hi>Morbian</hi> in <hi>Brettaign.</hi> The King commanded the Duke of <hi>Guyſe</hi> to receive him with all poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Honour; and indeed ſuch it was, that <hi>Don Frederick</hi> could not enough admire, at the manner of his entertainment. Shortly after he departed towards the Ile of <hi>Ree,</hi> where at that time was no great need of him: But however he proffered his ſervice unto the King, who received him with great kindneſs; His Majeſty ſending to viſit him, but his veſſels were found ſo unprovided of victuals, men and neceſſaries, that thoſe things together with his long delay conſidered. It was eaſie to Judg, they had no great mind to fight for <hi>France,</hi> and that the King his Maſter would be very ſorry to contribute to the taking of <hi>Rochel;</hi> a place which might be made uſe of to raiſe a war in the Kingdome, and that with a little charge, if he had a mind to ſend any Forces to them. At laſt he gave an aſſured ſign of the truth of this ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpition, when not long after he went to his Majeſty, and took his leave of him, to return towards <hi>Spain,</hi> telling him that he could not now be any more ſerviceable to him. The King would have much wondered to ſee him ſo haſty to be gon, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering he came ſo far, but that he knew they had more mind to ingage <hi>France</hi> in a war with a third party then adventure on it themſelves. His Majeſty on the other ſide knowing; That ſtrangers and Forraign Forces ought not be employed but in urgent occaſions, and at laſt caſt, did ſo much the eaſilier conſent to his departure, and in regard too that the Cardinal had aſſured him, That great ſtore of veſſels would very ſhortly come before <hi>Rochel;</hi> So he finding the wind fair, hoyſed ſail about the end of <hi>January</hi> to return to <hi>Spain.</hi>

                  <p>THere may ſuch occaſions in war fall out, that it may be abſolutely neceſſary to make uſe of Forraign Forces, and the very greateſt Princes are ſubject here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, becauſe at ſome one time, or other, they may chance be ſo ſurpriſed, that it may be impoſſible for their own proper Forces to repel the Enemy who aſſaults them. But without doubt, he that can make a ſhift without them, does wiſely not to make any uſe of them at all, for relying on the Forces of ſtrangers, he doth in ſome ſort make himſelf dependant on that Prince who aſſiſteth him, and alſo, they cannot in reaſon be ſo loyal, faithful, and courageous in any his affairs, as his own ſubjects. Forriners fight more for gain, and their own particular Intereſt, then for any good will to him, unto whom they are ſent; inſomuch that could they find any where elſe more advantageous conditions, though it were in the very adverſe party, they would make no ſcruple of running in unto them. This hath been formerly evidenced by the <hi>Celtiberi,</hi> who having bin firſt ſuborned by the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans left the <hi>Carthagians,</hi> and not long after were regained by thoſe of <hi>Carthage,</hi> and did as ſoon forſake the Roman Army, and return to their firſt Maſters.

                  <p>The Baylif of <hi>Dion,</hi> who had raiſed them, together with ſome others could not eſcape their fury, they were taken by them, and could not get off until they were ſatisfied to the utmoſt farthing of their due. Whereas on the other ſide, a Princes own ſubjects are tyed to him, by the fidelity which they owe to his Crown, and though not punctually paid, yet do they continue Loyal and courageous; and whilſt they fight for their own Intereſt and glory, no doubt but they will ſhew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves more reſolute and daring then ſtrangers, who have not any of thoſe concerns. All Princes who ever obtained any ſignal victories, have been beholding to their own native forces for them. The Turkiſh Emperour, uſeth no other. <hi>Alexander</hi> by this means in a little while made ſo great a progreſſe in Armes, as never any one
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:56802:112"/>did the like. I ſuppoſe that it is with Armies, compoſed of a mans own ſubjects as with the natural clean ſtrength of a mans own body, which is much more to be eſteemed, then that which is infuſed by art into ſick perſons: That Prince who uſeth ſtrangers, cannot more fitly be compared to any thing then a man in a lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing condition, whoſe natural heat is decayed, who to warm and comfort his ſtomach hath recourſe to ſpices, which inſtead of preſerving him ſcorch up his bloud and deſtroy his life; for juſt ſo do ſtrangers, to him that depends on them, advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage him they cannot, but will (it may be) ruin him, as before is manifeſted by divers pregnant Reaſons.</p>

                  <p>THE ſame day that <hi>Don Frederich de Toledo</hi> ſet ſail for his return, came the <hi>Marquis Spinola</hi> from the low Countries, and having paſſed by <hi>Paris,</hi> where the Queen received him with great Honour, arrived at the <hi>Camp</hi> before <hi>Rochel,</hi> with his Son his Son-in-Law and the <hi>Marquis de Leganez,</hi> Ambaſſador Extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary from <hi>Spain.</hi> The <hi>Marſhal de Schomberg</hi> went a League out to receive them, by the Kings deſire, and after he was arrived, the King Commanded him to be viſited with great Honour. His Audience was granted very ſhortly thereupon, with all the endearments that poſſible could be expreſſed. Amongſt other things the King told him, that he came into thoſe parts againſt his Phiſitians advices, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not yet quite recoverd of a troubleſome ſickneſs, but he was forced to it, to drive out the Engliſh, from his Teretories, who indeed had not made any long ſtay; That having perceived his ſubjects of <hi>Rochel,</hi> to have been the Bringers in of the Engliſh, he reſolved to puniſh them for it, and to take them by ſiedg, in which he obſerved for a pattern, that which was made at <hi>Breda;</hi> and then he invited them to ſee the Works, though at that time they were not quite finiſhed. The <hi>Marquis</hi> highly extolled all his Majeſties Actions, eſpecially that of beating the Engliſh from <hi>Ree.</hi> He told him, that his Preſence made his Nobility invincible, and withal, that indeed nothing was ſo glorious for a man of quality, as to fight in his Princes ſight; That for his part it grieved him never to have had the King his Maſter, for a witneſs of his Actions and that he ſhould willingly dye, to obtain that Honour. After he had gone the round, he went to ſee the Banck, which he much admired, and openly ſaid, that if they finiſhed that work of ſhutting up the <hi>Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel,</hi> and keeping the Souldiers in good order, it would be impoſſible for the town to eſcape taking. He well knew, what place the Cardinal was in, neer his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty and that the King had not engaged himſelf in this deſign, but by his advice; he obſerved that the admirable order kept in the ſiedg, was an effect of his Conduct; ſo he went to viſit him, with great Reſpects. The Cardinal received him with the like, they continued a long while in diſcourſe together, during which they inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changably contracted a very great friendſhip with each other, which was the cauſe, that afterwards meeting in <hi>Piedmont,</hi> one in the behalf of <hi>France,</hi> and t'other of <hi>Spain</hi> they carried on the war with courteſie and courage: ſhewing that civilities and kindneſſes might be uſed amongſt Enemies, without prejudice, to their Maſters Intereſts.</p>

                  <p>THE entertaining of ſtrangers, who paſſe by a Princes Court, with Honour, if they are conſiderable either in their Births or Actions, doth much advantage the glory of a Prince. He who would be eſteemed a generous Prince as well abroad, as at home, is obliged to it; The Honour which he doth to ſuch Perſons, is a Ray of Glory, which by reverberation doth reflect on himſelf, for they who receive his kindneſs are bound to be the Trumpeters of his Praiſe. Though the Romans
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:56802:112"/>ſlighted all ſtrangers, eſteeming them Barbarous, yet they had a Law, whereby they were bound to receive them, with greater Honour and reſpect when they came to the City of <hi>Rome.</hi> And that I may a little open the quality, of their reception. I ſhall firſt obſerve that it ought to be with all kind of civility and courteſie; For this vertue is a Charm, ſo powerful, and ſo captivating the ſoul: That as <hi>Lewis</hi> the Eleventh ſaid, it doth ſometimes of the greateſt Enemies raiſe up the perfecteſt friends; whence it hapned that he himſelf, took great care and delight to careſſe ſuch ſtrangers, as at any time paſſed through his Court; beſides it paſſeth for a mark of Courage and Reſolution, whereas, inſolencie is only an Index of lowneſs and meanneſs of Spirit. This courteſie ought to be accompanied with magnificence, that it may be the more conſiderable, for words and behaviour, do lightly paſſe away, if not followed by ſome other effects. This magnifience conſiſteth, in Treating them with ſplendor, for that the good entertainment which is given them, ſerveth no leſſe to teſtifie the affection, then the great and noble mind of him who maketh it. <hi>Paulus Aemilius</hi> was very induſtrious in making all people wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, who came to viſit him, and being one day asked the reaſon of it, he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, that there was as great prudence in the well diſpoſal of a feaſt, as in the Marſhalling of an Army for the Battail, for the one is to become terrible to ones Enemies and t'other agreeable to his friends. Next, he is bound to make them preſents, according to their qualities. A little expence of this nature gives Princes a great reputation amongſt ſtrangers; for they on whom it is beſtowed are care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of preſerving it in their families, as a teſtimony of the Honour which they have received by ſuch a head, which they keep as Proofs of his magnificence, and I ſhould think it much better, to cut off from any other expences, then from this. <hi>Ageſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laus</hi> ſaid, That which appeared moſt Illuſtrious and glorious in all Kings, was, the doing good to divers perſons; the Ambaſſadors of <hi>Corinth</hi> refuſing to receive <hi>Dionyſius</hi> of <hi>Siracuſa's</hi> Preſents he ſeemed to be much offended at it, and told them, that this was one of the chief means which Kings had to make themſelves glorious: In fine, who ſo wants liberality, is never heartily ſerved by his own nor honoured by ſtrangers.</p>

But the Duke had ſeveral misfortunes which croſſed him, and that in the beginning of the year at <hi>Montpellier,</hi> was none of the leaſt; He had Commanded his Kinſman the <hi>Baron de Bretigni</hi> to come to this Town, under pretence of a certain ſuit of Law in the Court of Aydes there, but with deſign, to ſurpriſe the Cittadell if poſſible it might be effected; <hi>Bretagny</hi> ſet his engines on work, ſo gain the <hi>Baron de Millay,</hi> laſt Captain of the Regiment of <hi>Normandie,</hi> and one of his old acquaintance unto his purpoſe: He pretended himſelf very willing and ready to heaken to his propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions, and to ſerve him, in that particular deſign; But in the mean while the <hi>Baron de Milay,</hi> gave notice of it, to the <hi>Marquis de Foſſez,</hi> who was very glad of this diſcovery, and adviſed him not to looſe the oportunity of getting advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages from his Majeſtie by this piece of ſervice. The Baron aſſured him by all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtations of his fidelity and zeal; and in fine he got out all the deſigns of the Duke <hi>de Rohan,</hi> by which he pretended to ſteer himſelf; and he behaved himſelf in this affair with ſo much addreſſe, that the Duke Imagined, he had not a more faithful friend then the <hi>Baron</hi> was. In this confidence the Duke advanced his Troops about the beginning of the year, towards <hi>Montpellier,</hi> giving out he intended to beſiedg <hi>Corcown,</hi> and about two or three at night, came to execute his deſign: But the <hi>Marquis de Foſſez,</hi> who had punctual Intelligence of all his deſigns, made preparation to receive him, according to his deſerts. He ordered every thing in
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:56802:113"/>the Cittadel, that nothing could fall out amiſſe, and then he hid in Ambuſh neer the Gate by which they were to march in, the moſt choiſe Souldiers which he had; he ordered one of his Souldiers, to cut the Cord of the <hi>Port-Cullis,</hi> when they were once got in, that he might make ſure of them, and cut them off. In this interim the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> ſent one of his Captains to the <hi>Baron</hi> of <hi>Millay,</hi> to be informed of the State of the place, and to learn what order ſhould be obſerved for their coming in: The <hi>Baron,</hi> ſhewed him all the City, and every place adjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, only excepting that where the Souldiers were hid; The Captain fully informed and ſatisfied returns to the Duke, gives him an accompt, of what he had ſeen and concluded. The Duke, hereupon advanceth his Troops, to the Counterſcarp, and <hi>Bretigny</hi> leading them on, the <hi>Baron de Mellay,</hi> forthwith opened the Port. <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigny</hi> enters with fifty perſons of quality and the <hi>Baron d' Aubes,</hi> following of him with the ſecond train of fifty more, all which got in at the ſame dore. Now he who was commanded to cut the Cord of the <hi>Port-Cullis,</hi> did it ſooner then he ſhould have done, which vexed the <hi>Marquis de Foſſez</hi> to the very heart, for had he let it alone but a little longer, the Duke had loſt at leaſt four thouſand men: But however to puniſh thoſe who had been ſo hardy as to enter, the Souldiers in <hi>Ambuſh,</hi> let fly at them, and cut them all off; thirty nine of them were Officers, and of good quality; and the <hi>Marquis Spinola</hi> being then at <hi>Rochel,</hi> when the news came, openly ſaid, that this blow was of greater concern to the Duke of <hi>Rohan,</hi> then if he had loſt two thouſand Souldiers. Neither was this all, for the <hi>Marquis de Feſſez</hi> made the great Guns be ſhot off at random upon thoſe Troops which had not come in, and the morning following there was good ſtore of bloud to be ſeen in ſeveral places, which made the <hi>Marquis</hi> conclude there were many more killed and wonded, but that the Duke had cauſed them to be carried off with him.</p>

                  <p>NAture, which hath given Arms to all Creatures to defend themſelves, hath beſtowed on man underſtanding, that by it, he is able to protect himſelf, from any dangers which threaten him, which Arms are more to be eſteemed then thoſe of Force. One of the greateſt perfections of it, is, to deceive a publique Enemy, and to repel Force by Force, and Mines by Countermines. Amongſt other Inventions which it affordeth; That, of pretending as correſpondence, with an Enemy, is not one of the leaſt conſiderable, as <hi>Zenophon</hi> ſaith, It being certain, that a pretended Intelligence with an Enemy, and well mannaged, doth often effect, greater things, then Force it ſelf. I ſhall add too, That they are much more glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, and that the greateſt reputation of a Chieftain is to break an Enemies ſtrength, by Plots and contrivances, and to deſtroy him by his own deſigns. It is indeed commendable to repulſe an Enemy from an aſſault, by valour and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, but much more, to ruin an Enemies intents and purpoſes, by deſigns, in which the Souldiers lives are not endangered. In <hi>Sparta</hi> he was much more eſteemed, who gained a victory by pollicy, then he who carried it by Force of Arms.

In the mean while they inform the Governour of it, who laid ſome certain Souldiers in ambuſh neer the Gate, by which they were to enter, by which means he ſlew about a hundred on the place,

                  <p>THE Cardinal who dived into the Counſels and deſigns of Forraign Princes, acquainted his Majeſty with thoſe promiſes the Engliſh had made to aſſiſt the <hi>Rochelois,</hi> and that his preſence would be very needful in the Camp, both to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage his Souldiers, as alſo to haſten on the works where every one in his ſight would labour in emulation of one another. But on the other ſide his Majeſty was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed that his being ſo far from <hi>Paris</hi> had given opportunity to the Hugonots, of the Provinces neer adjoyning to make aſſemblies, and to incourage the people to revolt. He was adviſed of ſeveral meetings which they made in <hi>Picardie, Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagne</hi> and <hi>Brie,</hi> under divers pretences, as ſometimes of Civility, of a wedding, or ſome quarrel, in all which meetings, there were means uſed to perſwade the people to riſe and take up Arms.

In the mean while, that no time might be loſt, and that the Rebels might have no advantage, order was ſent to the Queen Mother, to ſecure the Counts <hi>de la Suſe,</hi> and <hi>de Rouſſy</hi> in the <hi>Baſtile.</hi> The former ſhe arreſted by an Exempt in her Antichamber, and the ſecond at <hi>Rouſſy</hi> by the Duke <hi>d' Elboeuf.</hi> The King having reſolved upon his Journy, thought it neceſſary, to commit the care of the ſiedge, of finiſhing the works and the Bank, and of keeping the Souldiers in obedience and from disbanding, which they formerly uſed to do upon his Majeſties removal, unto ſome Perſon, whoſe dilligence and credit might be capable of giving ſucceſſe to it. Beſides it was neceſſary, that this perſon ſhould be exceeding Loyal, for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting that misfortune which befel <hi>Charles</hi> the ninth, when he lay before the ſame town, where he was put unto infinite trouble and charge, and all to no purpoſe, becauſe they whom he truſted with the Chief commands and orders were not faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and true to him. It being very difficult to find all theſe three qualities in any one Perſon, the King caſt his eyes on the Cardinal, as the only man, in whom he could totally confide for carrying on of the ſiedge, and all other things, in order thereunto. His Majeſty diſcourſed with him to that purpoſe; now the Cardinal although he was not ignorant, that the abſence of the Court, is commonly a great diſadvantage, to ſuch as are in favour, by reaſon of the oportunity which they who are envious of their condition, have to work them a miſchief, yet he readily accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of that employment, and proteſted to his Majeſty, that he would not ſpare any pains or diligence to bring it to a happy iſſue, though it coſt his blood and life, which he ſhould think well ſacrificed in his Majeſty ſervice; ſo the King gave him a full power to diſpoſe of all things during his abſence, and gave him the command over the Duke of <hi>Angouleſme,</hi> the <hi>Marſhals de Baſſompierre</hi> and <hi>Schomberg,</hi> the <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhals</hi> of the <hi>Camp,</hi> the Maſter of the Artillerie and all other Inferiour Officers what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever: But I cannot omit with what reluctancy his Majeſty went from him to <hi>Paris,</hi> For it is very remarkable, that his Majeſty having received the Adieux of all his Officers, rid up apart to a certain perſon of quality, who was then to receive his Commands for <hi>Italy,</hi> and keeping cloſe with him ſaid not a word for a good while together, ſo troubled he was at his departure, until at laſt my heart quoth he, is ſo ſad and heavy, to leave <hi>Monſieur</hi> the Cardinal, for fear leaſt ſome miſhap befal him, that I am hardly able to ſpeak for grief; and therefore tell him from me, that if he would have me think he loveth me, that he muſt be careful of himſelf, and that he adventure not hereafter into any of thoſe dangers, which he uſually doth: That he conſider in what ſtate my affairs would be, if I ſhould looſe him: I am not ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant,

Theſe words were very obliging, and aſſured teſtimonies of the great affection, which his Majeſty had for him.

                  <p>THE love of a Prince is a great Honour to a Stateſman, and that not only in reſpect of the particular Benefit which floweth from it, but alſo in regard of the Publique good which he doth watch over: Where he is not beloved, he wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth authority, without which he cannot do any thing worth conſideration: For the obtaining of this love then he ought to uſe his utmoſt art and diligence, and he is bound to prefer it, before his own or any other Intereſts whatever.</p>

This ought to be the Rule of a Chief Miniſters conduct, when he finds himſelf in his Maſters good eſteem; For to hope, that he may pleaſe his Soveraign and the Lords of his Court too, is a vanity, and can never be brought to paſſe. Now to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent he may enjoy his Maſters love in an eminent degree, I ſhould adviſe him not to rely too much on Fortune, but to follow <hi>Plato's</hi> adviſe, who in his Book <hi>de Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blicâ</hi> ſaith. That to be a King and to Rule, to ſerve and be beloved, to fight and overcome, are three ſuch things as a man need not trouble himſelf to look after, they being the Guifts of Fortune and only ſubjected to her power, who granteth them to whom the pleaſeth. I am not of his opinion, but do ſuppoſe that a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter is bound, having once obtained any great credit in his Maſters ſoul to uphold it by all the cares and diligences, which may render him beloved. Philoſophy teacheth very well, That to obtain ones deſire, there ought to be cauſes applied to the ſubject, by which a man deſigns to work: whence it followeth that thoſe qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities which make a man perfect and accompliſhed, are the true cauſes of love, ſo that he is obliged to let his Maſter ſee he is endued with thoſe and the like recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations and vertues; amongſt which, I place that of a faithful ſervant in the Front; For as an ancient hath obſerved, ſervices have a particular attractive power in them, which inſinuate affection, and charm the mind: Thoſe ſubjects which are moſt uſeful, are moſt beloved: and as nothing is beloved but for Intereſt; ſo thoſe perſons who are moſt conducing to the good of the State, and the preſervation of their Maſters Authoritie are ever beſt affected. And to ſpeak the truth, I believe that neceſſity maketh them more conſiderable then any other quality whatever; For as the Bough of a Tree, is in conſiderable in reſpect of the whole Body, yet it is of great uſe to him, who without it, were in hazard of being drowned: Juſt ſo is it with him, he is beloved, embraced and eſteemed above all things, when there is a need or want of him. But a Miniſter, what neceſſity ſo ever a Prince hath of him ought not, if he would be dear to his Maſter, become importunate or craving, either by being alwayes in his ſight, on by begging any favour or boon of him. Too great a Familia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity will bring his qualities into contempt, how eminent ſo ever they be, and the conſideration of his ſervices would be much diminiſhed by his importunities. <hi>L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

The ſureſt Rules which in this caſe is to be obſerved, is this, To ſee him but ſeldome to ſpeak but little to him, unleſſe when occaſions of State require it and then too, with great reſpect and ſubmiſſion, and in ſuch terms as may never claſh with his Maſters thoughts and mind. If there be any ill news to be diſcourſed let
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:56802:114"/>others, firſt acquaint him with them. The Souls of great men hate ill tidings, as of Broyles and Inſurrections, things which diminiſh the reſpects which are due to their Authority. He will not a little Fix and ſettle himſelf in his Maſters favour, by teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying a good courage in his occaſions, and affairs. The Reaſon of this is, Princes do naturally love thoſe who are men of reſolution, they look on ſuch as the ſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of their State, Authority, and lives, and they who are themſelves the greateſt cowards, do yet love ſuch as are courageous, ſtout and hardy. <hi>Phalaris</hi> the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant hath given us an example of this particular, when he writ to a certain emulator of his; I confeſſe thou art a good man, and thou canſt not deny but all in thy houſe are bad, whereas if thou doeſt obſerve any vice in my perſon, yet thou wilt find me ſtill attended by wiſe learned and courageous followers and attendants. Theſe are the Chief Buttreſſes, which ſupport a Miniſters favour: to theſe I will only add, That ſeeing there are not any qualities how eminent ſoever, which the envy of ſome or other, will not attempt to diſguiſe unto his Prince, he therefore ought with great care to remove ſuch perſons from him, and that with the more Authority, in regard Juſtice alloweth of the puniſhing ſuch who requite ſervices done for the Common good with Ingratitude.</p>

                  <p>THE Prudence of a King is no leſſe demonſtrable, in his choiſe of Officers, than in his Commands: and in particular, the King acquired no leſſe Glory in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting the care of the ſiedge of <hi>Rochel,</hi> unto the Cardinal, then if he had been there in perſon. The whole management of affairs did evidence, how judicious a choiſe his Majeſty had made. For <hi>Monſieur</hi> the Cardinal every day animated the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers by his preſence; payed them weekly; gave them cloths to preſerve them from the cold; every day overſaw all his Officers and Commanders, to give them ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary inſtructions, and to redouble their courages by his words and Actions; by theſe means he ſo haſtned on the works both by Sea and Land, that his Majeſty at his return, found the firſt finiſhed, and the ſecond in ſuch forwardneſs, that it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved to be eſteemed the eighth wonder of the World. The Souldiers who are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally addicted to mutinies, and plunderings, lived in ſuch decorum, that they had loſt their very inclinations, to one or t'other; the Country men brought their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions into the Camp, without fear, and received ready mony for them. The Marchants kept open their ſhops, as if it had been in a well governed City; drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſs and ſwearing, were criminal faults: And the Religious Perſons, whom his Majeſty had ſent thither of all ſorts, and orders, were reſpected, and held in ſuch eſteem, as if they had been in a Church. The moſt experienced in Military affairs, could not ſufficiently admire the Cardinals conduct, in ſo much that they who knew him not, would have imagined he had been bred all dayes of his life in the wars. Some certain Perſons there were, who flattered the Ambition of thoſe Grandees then under his Command, by telling them, it was unfit for them to obey a man of his Profeſſion; ſeeing their Offices gave them power to Command in his Majeſties abſence; But the wonders of his conduct and courage were ſuch, that they were forced to confeſs, nothing could out do him; and that conſidering how many ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſes he did atchieve unto <hi>France,</hi> by one and t'other, it were unreaſonable not to obey his Majeſties choiſe of him, every one in particular acknowledging, that no one but himſelf, could under go thoſe daily laborious knotty difficulties, which he ſo eaſily did.</p>

                  <p>MIlitary diſcipline ought the more carefully to be obſerved, in order to good ſucceſſe, becauſe without it, nothing followeth, but confuſion. <hi>Vegetius,</hi> a man well verſed in ſuch affairs, ſaith; The Romans had never been ſo potent, but
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:56802:115"/>by their continual order and exerciſe, in Arms. The ſtrength of a Fort, conſiſteth more in the Form, then the matter: the Power of an Army is undoubtedly as great by the good order amongſt them, as by their numbers. Diſcipline is one of the Chief ſinews of war, and as a Body ſoon fals to the ground, if thoſe nervers which are deſtinated for its Motion, be cut in ſender, ſo is it with an Army, they ſoon moulder away to nothing, if not kept together, in good diſcipline and order, and on the other ſide, where they are ſo diſciplined they bring wonders to paſſe, with little care or trouble. <hi>Alexander</hi> being asked, by what means he became Maſter of the Univerſe, ſaid, by the diſcipline and good order, which his Souldiers obſerved, by the good Counſel which they had, and the eloquence he uſed in animating them, and withal he added, that he knew not any means more powerful to execute the greateſt exployts in warfare. <hi>Domitius Corbulo,</hi> with ten thouſand Roman foot, and ſome few of his Allayes, ſuſtayned all the attempts, of a multitude of Parthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and this he did only by the good order and diſcipline he cauſed them to obſerve. The Chief points of this order were according to <hi>Tacitus,</hi> firſt to prevent any of their disbanding; a thing of ſo great importance, that without it, the greateſt Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies melt in a little whiles to nothing, and this ought to be effected, either by fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing the Souldiers with all things neceſſary, or by ſeverly puniſhing ſuch as offer without leave to forſake their colours. The ſecond was that, no one durſt go out to fight without Command given for it: a thing of no leſſe importance then the firſt: For they who fight contrary to, or againſt their Commanders order, are eaſily overcome both becauſe they are not as wel informed, as becauſe they ever fight in diſorder.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Germans,</hi> which went to relieve <hi>Ferdinand</hi> King of <hi>Napels,</hi> may ſerve for an example of this kind, for preſently upon their arrival, being provoked by an extreame deſire, to make themſelves famous by ſome exploit or other, they adventured to ſally out of Troye, contrary to the order of <hi>Fabritius Colonna</hi> Governour of the Town, that they might joyne themſelves with King <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> and fight thoſe Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies who oppoſed their paſſage; but <hi>Monſieur de Montpenſier</hi> perceiving it, fell upon them in a place where they could neither fight, nor ſave themſelves by flight, by which means not a man eſcaped. The third was, that all guards, day labourers, and ſentinels, ſhould ſtand to their Arms, day and night he having put two Souldiers to death, for having found them at work in the Trenches the one without his Arms, and t'other only with his dagger: The reaſon hereof is, becauſe by this means, an Army cannot be ſurprized by an Enemy, and that in caſe he ſhould attempt any thing on the Camp, he would alwayes find them ready to reſiſt him. <hi>Avidius Caſſius</hi> eſteemed all theſe three points of ſo great concernment in Arms, that he thought ſuch as did not exactly obſerve them, deſerved to be cruelly puniſhed, he uſually cut off their legs and Arms, who left the Army without leave, and he forbore putting them to death, becauſe quoth he it is a greater example of ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, for a man to living in miſery and ſhame, then to dye. It one day hapened that his Souldiers diſcovered the <hi>Sarmatians</hi> kept no very ſtrict watch, ſo they ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed them, fell in upon them, and killed three thouſand of them, but for their puniſhment he crucified all the Captains, alleadging, that the <hi>Sarmatians</hi> might have had ſome ambuſh for them, unknown to them, which if it had ſo been, they might by their raſhneſſe, have diſcredited the Roman Honour and Glory: Neither was he leſſe ſever, in puniſhing thoſe, who had ſtollen any thing, from their quarters. The Emperour <hi>Aurelian,</hi> was ſo ſtrict in this particular, that he writ to a Tribune, that as he tendred his life, he ſhould ſuppreſſe his Souldiers from ſtealing, but told him, they muſt look to enrich themſelves, by the pillaging of their Enemies, not by the tears of his and their friends. I ſhall only add, that the Souldiers ought to be trained up to the uſe and exerciſe of their Arms, which both keeps them from Idleneſs, and worſe things, and maketh them perfect in their Trade; and if they have any other leaſure time over and above, it were not amiſſe to find them out ſome diverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons or entertainment, it being otherwiſe hard to keep them from disbanding. <hi>Marcus Aemilius,</hi> finding his Souldiers lazy and in want of employment made them pave the way between <hi>Plaiſance</hi> and <hi>Riminy:</hi> and <hi>Julius Veter,</hi> made his work in a Channel, to joyn the <hi>Sarna</hi> with <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>DUring his Majeſty abſence, the Cardinal, diſirous to ſave him the trouble of returning back to the ſiedge, and knowing how needful it was to prevent the Engliſh arrival, beſides his great courage being impatient of delay, attempted all means to make ſome enterpriſe upon <hi>Rochel.</hi> He propoſed the breaking open one of the Gates, and then the falling in with ſo great force, as might carry the place, and having diſcourſed it with the Marſhal <hi>de Schomberg,</hi> he at laſt concluded on it, and carried his deſign ſo cloſe and private, that had not <hi>Marillac,</hi> Marſhal of the <hi>Camp,</hi> in the Duke of <hi>Angouleſmes</hi> quarter been faulty, he had doubtleſſe ſuccee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in it. The Cardinal had get together, whatever was proper or neceſſary, for the whole buſineſs. He gave out orders for the execution of it, the night being come, he aſſigned the Rendevouz, The Marſhal <hi>de Schomberg</hi> ſent divers Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies thither, with ladders and bridges to caſt over the Ditch: The <hi>Marquis de Roſelia</hi> Grand Maſter of the Artillery, brought with him Petards, Granadoes, and other Artificial Fier-works; The Cardinal was there in Perſon, within Musket ſhot of the Town, that he might ſhew ſome marks of his courage, upon the firſt open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Gate, and be ready to command in the aſſault, not like the Cardinal <hi>Ximenes</hi> at the taking of <hi>Oran,</hi> who was all the while at his Prayers in a Chappel, but like a General indeed, and ſuch a one as would incourage his Souldiers, by his own words and Actions, ſo that every one did plainly perceive he was no leſſe, Souldier and Captain, when occaſſion ſhould require it, then Cardinal in the Church and Counſel: He ſo behaved himſelf, that Hiſtorie need not make any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe for him, upon the ſcore of his profeſſion, as for that ſame Miniſter of <hi>Spain.</hi> But <hi>Marillac,</hi> who had the charge for the bringing on the moſt part of the Forces to Rendevouz, not comming to ſecond the courage of his General, rendered his Conduct and Valour, uſeleſſe. He was ſought after moſt part of the night, indeed, but could not any where be found, but about day break he appeared, with more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſes though, than courage: he endeavoured to excuſe himſelf, by many frivolous pretences, which the Cardinal was contented to put up, in conſideration of the Queen Mother, whoſe creature he was; yet was it a great diſpleaſure and vexation to him, when he came to draw off, leaſt the <hi>Rochellois</hi> ſhould have diſcovered them and beaten him off with loſſe.</p>

                  <p>FAint hartedneſs is an Enemy to all good ſucceſs: they who let it Maſter their courages, do ſhun all dangerous honorable attempts, and if ſhame be that which receiveth them, yet however they will never do any thing conſiderable For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune is a lover of vallour, favourer of the daring, and courageous, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly crowneth their attempts with ſucceſſe. Great fears, meet great hazards, and great Reſolutions, great ſucceſſes: it being as <hi>Saluſt</hi> ſaith, moſt certainly true; Great Reſolutions are like Rampards in a Battail, every thing gives way to their attempts: and a laſſe every little thing repulſeth a party, poſſeſſed with fear, and want of courage; To fear is to be half overcome: If any one ſhould aske the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of it, there is only this to be given. They fancy precipices, in plain wayes; they are ever upon the buſineſs of conſultation, never that of execution; they love to recede from all obſtacles, which ſeem to oppoſe them, not to vanquiſh or break through them; and if perchance they are forced to fight, they do it ſo coldly, that they give their enemies al kind of advantages by it: Fear ſeemeth to have diſpoſſeſſed them of Life and Soul; and whereas the face of dangers ſhould ſerve to ſtir them to generous Actions; It rebates them to an immovableneſs, as if they were voyd of ſence or motion. I may well liken them to the Timerous Hindes, which retain their Fruit to the very laſt for fear of the pains, which they endure in bringing forth, and
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:56802:116"/>would not then produce their young ones, but for fear of a greater miſchief; or elſe I may liken them unto the Elephant which is ten years in breeding, or to the Palm, which according to the Naturaliſts is a hundred years before it yeeld any Dates, for eyer thus it is with them, the apprehenſions of dangers maketh them fearfull, and to ſeek cut any occaſions to avoid fighting, and if it ſhould happen, that they cannot prevent it, they do it ſo lamely, that they onely do it for fear of death.

                  <p>THe King had not long been at <hi>Paris,</hi> but he underſtood the Engliſh Fleet was ready to hoiſe Sail for <hi>Rochel,</hi> which made him reſolve upon his return thither: I cannot omit obſerving how this reſolution of his, was a mark both of his wiſdome and courage, who as he is not to be cheated out of his Authority by Cabals and Intreagues, ſo is he not to be retarded by any fear of danger, from thoſe occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons where he might acquire an accrument of glory. At this time it was, that the Lord Keeper <hi>Marillac,</hi> and thoſe of his Faction, began to lay the foundation of the Cardinall intended ruine; but it onely ſerved to convince and ſhew unto his Majeſty, that one of the greateſt miſchiefs whereunto a Soveraign can be expoſed, is to be incompaſed with ſuch perſons as are paſſionately bent againſt his chief Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter. The malice which they did bear againſt his glory finding him much advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, before the ſiege of <hi>Rochel,</hi> of which he was the firſt contriver, did much inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate them againſt him. They were angry that he had finiſhed his works in ſuch good order, though the enemies of the Kingdome could not ſufficiently admire them: it grieved them to ſee the place in a condition of being taken by his means; and to prevent it, they now reſolved to uſe their utmoſt indeavour to raiſe up the Hugonot party, that they might force the King from the ſiege of it.</p>
                  <p>Now as it was eaſie to judge, that in caſe his Majeſty ſhould return to <hi>Rochel,</hi> he would repulſe the Engliſh, and being followed by many of the Nobility and Lords, who are alwaies obſerved to be the Authors of victory and ſucceſſe, that he would likewiſe infallibly force the Town, ſo they uſed a thouſand devices to ſtay him at <hi>Paris.</hi> The Lord Keeper <hi>Marillac</hi> told him with many expreſſions of an extraordinary paſſion for his ſervice, that conſidering how ſtrong the Engliſh fleet was, in compariſon of his Majeſties, the iſſue of the battel ought to be doubted, how great reſiſtance they would make, and a thouſand other inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces he alleged would follow, in caſe they ſhould get the better of the day. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers indeavoured to diſſwade him by a tacite diſcommending the ayr of <hi>Rochel,</hi> which might much indanger his health, eſpecially during the moiſture of the ſpring every one commending the Valor and Conduct of <hi>Monſieur</hi> the Cardinal, the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to diſguiſe their malice, and petſwading his Majeſty totally to rely upon his care in the management of the ſiege. But they found the Pannick fears; made no im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion upon his Majeſties reſolutions, which made them deſign to affrighten his Majeſty and the Queen-mother, as one whoſe Sex is moſt capable of fears, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwading themſelves, that in caſe he could be prevented by ſome apprehenſion, ſhe might then have power enough over the King, to ſtay him at <hi>Paris.</hi> Divers La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies who had the honour to be neer her, were won at that time to work ſeveral con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivances to that purpoſe, but all to no purpoſe. It is true their deſign was not
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:56802:116"/>onely to hinder the Cardinal from reaping the glory due unto him by the taking of <hi>Rochel,</hi> but totally to ruine him, as hereafter ſhall be ſhewed. Now was it not a little conducing to that purpoſe, to ſtay the King at <hi>Paris,</hi> for his Majeſty not going to animate his Army by his preſence, they would not onely have made leſſe reſiſtance to the Engliſh, but alſo many Lords and Gentlemen obliged to attend his perſon, would not have been there, by which means, the Engliſh would have had the advantage of releeving-<hi>Rochel,</hi> and the whole blame of that miſ-fortune would have been laid on the Cardinal, which they thought enough to diſgrace him, and ſave his Majeſties honour. Theſe were the firſt foundations which this Cabal projected againſt the glory and favour of this grand Miniſter. But they were all too weak, to ſurpriſe the Kings mind, who no wayes ignorant how neceſſary his preſence was in ſuch an encounter, would not refuſe it, to the honour of his Crown and the repoſe of <hi>France,</hi> which did much depend upon it. He called to mind the example of the late King his father, who deliberating whether or no he ſhould go to the relief of <hi>Calais,</hi> ſo powerfully aſſaulted by the Spaniards that there were ſmall hopes to hinder their taking of it, ſaid, the place would aſſuredly be taken, if he went not in perſon to releeve it, and that it might ſo happen that his preſence might ſave it; and therefore that it was better to hazard this latter, then to leave the former without remedy, preferring his honour and the publick good, before the particular conſideration of his perſon. The ſame courage carried his Majeſty to the moſt glorious and honourable deſign, that his good fortune, with that of <hi>France</hi> could lead him to undertake, which was, forthwith to depart. Upon the third of <hi>April</hi> he ſet forward from <hi>Paris,</hi> and arrived at <hi>Rochel</hi> on Eaſter-munday. Upon his arrival the Artillery both of the Forts and Ships ſaluted him, and his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence ſo revived the Army, that every one redoubled his courage and affection to behave themſelves with reſolution: There were but the <hi>Marilacs</hi> and thoſe of their faction, who were troubled to ſee him on the Theater of his glory; but the Laurels which his Majeſty gathered there, did ſerve to ſet forth unto what miſ-for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes a Prince is reduced, when he is councelled by paſſionate adviſers.</p>

                  <p>ONe of the moſt dangerous qualities, that he who is Councellour to a King can have, is to ſuffer himſelf to be tranſported with envy, hatred, anger, or any paſſion whatever. Wiſe Council is an affect of Prudent reaſon, and it can be no longer Prudent when it is once darkned, with the Clouds of ſome irregular moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The Iraſcible power, being once maſter of Reaſon, doth ſo obſcure it, that maketh men ſee no objects in their true colours, and that Paſſion carrieth it away where ever it pleaſeth with the ſame impetuouſneſſe as a hot metled horſe draws a Chariot into Precipices, that it is impoſſible to ſtay him. It is reported, that the Flowers of <hi>Egypt,</hi> being watered by the vapours of <hi>Nile,</hi> which are for the moſt part groſs and earthy, yeeld not any ſmell, and it is no leſſe certain, that a States<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, with how great a Genius ſoever he be indued, is no more capable to give good Counſel, after he hath once given himſelf up to envy or hatred: His Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on maketh him quarrel with truth it ſelf, and to approve of thoſe Councels which are moſt prejudicial to the State, that he may ſatisfie his own ſelf-will. The diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graces of others are his delights, Factions are his joys, and the ruine of thoſe whom he would deſtroy is his ſweeteſt and moſt pleaſing ſpectacle; neither is he concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned at the riſe or fall of any one, ſo he be ſatisfied in his own particular. To this purpoſe the Poets feigned, that <hi>Hercules</hi> being tranſported with anger knew not his wife or children, inſomuch that he tore them in pieces. But how many other true and aſſured proofs doth Hiſtory afford us? That of <hi>England</hi> tels us, how the Duke of <hi>York, Henry</hi> the Eighths Favourite, being diſ-affectionate to <hi>Spain,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies gave his Maſter advices in prejudice of <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth; and on the other ſide, being full of good will towards <hi>France,</hi> perſwaded him to ſuch reſolutions as might continue the friendſhip which was between them. <hi>Antiochus</hi> his Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:56802:117"/>being incenſed againſt <hi>Hannibal,</hi> cauſed him to be baniſhed from the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, though he were a perſon very neceſſary and uſefull to him. In fine, he who is maſtered by Paſſion, onely thinks of ſatiating himſelf for the obtaining thereof, he diſguiſeth the diſloyalty of his Counſels, with ſo many fair gloſſes and ſpecious colours that he may draw his Prince, to that end he aimeth at; by this means if his Prince have any confidence in him, he will eaſily deceive him, and quickly dead him into thoſe miſ-fortunes which he will ſoon perceive, but too late to get clear of them. All Soveraigns are not ſo fortunate as the Piſans, who refuſed to make a War againſt the Florentines being invited thereunto by the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Milan,</hi> for that <hi>Francis Gambacortij</hi> gave them to underſtand he onely adviſed to it, out of hatred to the Florentines, and not out of any advantage to their intereſts.</p>

                  <p>THe King being returned to the Army, cauſed the <hi>Rochelois</hi> to be ſummoned by a Herald to ſurrender, but their minds and anſwers were full of inſolency, ſo that his Majeſty bended all his thoughts to make preparations for the fighting with the Engliſh Fleet at their firſt comming. Divers Lords and Gentlemen of the Nation came from all parts to the Army, for this occaſion, and to partake of the glory of his Majeſties Arms; every one of them were on fire to be ingaged with the Engliſh and the Rochelois, that they might obtain a ſecond victory a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them. Now it being expedient that he who commandeth an Army, ſhould exactly know the condition and number of his forces, that he may the better re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve upon that which is neceſſary to be done, the King thought fit to make a muſter and to take a ſtrict view of the Army. He cauſed them to muſter in his own pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence which was no ſmall ſatisfaction to him, eſpecially when he obſerved how du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull they were, and how well Diſciplined, not ſtragling up and down as formerly they were wont to do, all which was an effect of the Cardinals admirable care, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, and Prudence. The Order which he had cauſed to be obſerved was this, every eight days there was a muſter of all the Souldiers, every Regiment having a Commiſſary appointed to it, to whom the Souldiers pay was diſtributed, and not to their Captains, as formerly had been the cuſtome: By this means the Captains were deprived of the power of muſtring any foiſted hirelings, and every week there was an exact number of the Army, that new recruits might be ſent for, if occaſion did require. This alteration you may imagine did much trouble divers Captains; eſpecially ſuch as preferred their own Intereſts before his Majeſties glory; but it cannot be expected how advantagious it was to the Kings ſervice, who thus review<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Army, found it compoſed of nineteen Regiments of foot, and eighteen Troops of Horſe; beſides a very great number of Volunteers; inſomuch that they were five and twenty thouſand men compleat. The King likewiſe took a view of all his Veſſels, and finding them to be in good order, and enough to ſecure the Channel from the Engliſh, he began to be impatient to ſee them appear, that he might make them pay for the raſhneſſe of their attempts, and ſignalize his own for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces by a ſecond Victory.</p>

                  <p>ONE of the chief cares a General ought to have is, that he keep his Forces in good order, that none of them run from their Coullors, or muſter any hire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings. It is a buſineſſe of ſo great importance, that oftentimes Victorie dependeth on it: as at <hi>Pavie,</hi> where the ill ſucceſſe which befell <hi>Francis</hi> the firſt, is by divers Hiſtorians attributed to the defect of this particular, for onely looking over the Commiſſaries Roules, he thought there had bin full as many Souldiers as were there liſted upon which the fight was begun, but loſt, and the King taken priſoner. Now for
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:56802:117"/>the ſtaying of Souldiers in an Army, one of the beſt ways according to <hi>Alexander Severus,</hi> is this, pay them well, clothe them well, ſhoe them well, arm them well feed them well, and ſo order the buſineſſe, that they may alwayes have ſome mony in their purſes: and when they be thus well uſed, ſuch as run from their Collours muſt then be ſevery puniſhed; <hi>Corbulo</hi> beheaded all ſuch, without mercy, and it was obſerved, that this ſeverity of his, was of great advantage to him, for by it, he kept all his toopes neer at a ſtay in point of Number: Neither is it leſſe needful, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent Captaines and Commiſſaries ſcroles, who can by a dangerous miracle, revive dead Souldiers, in their companies, and make more to appear then really they have. This is an inconveniency, of which the loſſe of the Kings mony, is the leaſt conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent evil; for if it happen that a Prince aſſure himſelf according to the Roles, is thereupon become confident in attempting any enterpriſes, he may perchance, when it comes to a trial, find himſelf much weaker, then he expected, and by that means run into the ſame premunire, that <hi>Francis</hi> the firſt did at <hi>Pavie.</hi> The beſt preventive Courſe in ſuch diſorders is that which <hi>Darius</hi> uſed, who notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the vaſtneſſe of his Armie: and the Extent of his States was however ſo careful of his Forces, that he would often review them in his own preſence, pay the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers with his own hands, and be perpetually in company with them, not onely that he might be particularly acquainted with them, but that he might take care to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide neceſſaries for them, encourage ſome, and reward others who had wel deſerved of him. If after all their cares the Captains ſhall ſtill preſume to make falſe muſters, both they and the Commiſſaries who admit of them ought to be puniſhed, with ſo much the more rigor, in regard their faults are of ſo dangerous a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>THE perpetual inſtance which they of <hi>Rochel</hi> made to the King of Great <hi>Brittain,</hi> at laſt wrought on him, to ſend out his Fleet to Sea, upon their firſt being ready for it, and about the eleventh of <hi>May</hi> they were diſcried two leagues off the point of <hi>Coreille.</hi> The light Veſſels which the Cardinal, (in his Majeſties ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, being then at <hi>Surgeres</hi>) had ſent out to diſcover, the Coaſt brought intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence that their Fleet conſiſted in four Pinnaces, ſeven men of War, of about one hundred and fifty Tun a peece, twenty ſmaller of neer one hundred Tuns, twenty Barques of about thirty and forty, and divers Fire-ſhips. There was ſuch order ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to repel them, in caſe they ſhould attempt to paſſe the Bank, that it would be almoſt an impoſſibility for them to effect it: For beſides there engines which were at the mouth of the Bark, there was alſo the Kings Fleet, compoſed of good ſtore Men of war, and divers other Veſſels which lay in the Channels. The Chevalier de <hi>Velencay</hi> was in the formoſt Ship of the vant-guard, and commanded as Vice-Admiral, who had order to grapple with the firſt Ship of the Enemies, and to fight thoſe who were in it; The others were to follow his example, and every one had or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to beat the Enemies as neer to the Shore, as poſſible they could, where they would find it a hard taske to get off in regard of the great ſhot from the Forts and Batteries thereabouts. If the Enemie ſhould break through all thoſe obſtacles, of the greater Veſſels &amp; ſhot from the Batteries, yet they would find themſelves en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled amongſt fourſcore other Veſſels, Gallies, Galliots, and Barques, from whence it would be difficult to get off, and at the worſt they would be ſtopped by thoſe veſſels which had been ſunk, or the firſt Palliſade of three and forty ſhips which were next to them. The Cardinal who knew that his Majeſties courage would lead him to every thing, preſently gave him advice of the arrival of the Engliſh, and his Majeſty preſently took horſe and came the ſame night to the Camp. The ſtrength of his Army, the Batteries which were built on the ſhores, and the good order which he obſerved both in his Land and Sea forces, baniſh'd all cauſes of fear from him, neither were his reſolutions leſſe fortified by the confidence which he
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:56802:118"/>had in God, for whoſe glory he did fight, more then for the Intereſts of his own Kingdome, to whom he cauſed publick Prayers to be made for his bleſſing on this occaſion. In ſhort, as he was not ignorant that the preſence of an enemy, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligeth him who commands to be the more vigilant, he ſent to diſcover the enemies Fleet at a nearer diſtance within Musket ſhot, then lying in the road of the <hi>Chef de Bay;</hi> he likewiſe called a Councel of War, where he reſolved upon the following order for his own Fleet: He commanded that upon the firſt motion of the enemy no Veſſel ſhould weigh Anchor untill they were neer at hand, and that then they ſhould board them before they came neer the Bank. That no Veſſel ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve his Companion being ingaged with the enemy, that in caſe any Veſſel were in purſuit of an enemy, and ſhould fall foul upon one of his own party, not yet pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, then the firſt veſſel ſhould caſt Anchor to the end to ſtay the enemy, that both might fall upon him; that if any veſſel were fired the Shallops ſhould preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly come to aſſiſt, and that in caſe ſhe were grappled with a Fire-ſhip, they ſhould remove the Wedges from the Cannons that they might ſhoot over: That in ſuch caſe too, they ſhould knock out the ends of their Barrels of Power, and pour in ſome Buckets of Water: That they ſhould not make ready any greater number of veſſels then the enemy ſhould bring in between the two points: That the ſhips ſhould every day ſend their Boats to watch before the Fleet, and that their chief care ſhould be to prevent the enemies Fire-ſhips, by ſurpriſing their Shallops in caſe they had any, or by caſting an harping Iron whereby to draw them off from the veſſels: That for the more readineſſe every veſſel ſhould have a grappling hook in the ſtern, and that when-ever the enemy ſhould hoiſe ſail, they ſhould have their long boats armed, and ready to advance with aſſiſtance againſt any fire, where it ſhould happen. This order was reſolved on by the King, aſſiſted with his Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals and Sea Captains, and ſo delivered to the Commander of <hi>Valencay</hi> Vice-Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral, who diſtributed it amongſt the Officers. Laſtly, his Majeſty took a review of all his Quarters and Batteries, to ſee if all were in condition to fight and repel the enemy, when-ever they ſhould appear.</p>

                  <p>OF all the Arts none more becommeth a Prince, than the Military, which not onely preſerves his own State to him, but gives him means to increaſe it and raiſe his power to a higher degree. It cannot be doubted but that it is one of the ſteadieſt Pillars of his Authority, ſeeing neither ſubjects or neighbours make any difficulty to aſſault him, whom they find negligent in Military Diſcipline. For this reaſon it was, that the wiſeſt amongſt the Romans, were againſt the ruine of <hi>Carthage;</hi> fore-ſeeing with much Prudence, that that City being no longer able to oppoſe the Roman greatneſſe, their Commanders would no more regard the trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning up of their Souldiers in the exerciſe of War, and by conſequence, put the Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire in danger of a total ruine. I ſhall hereto adde, that the Prince unskil'd in this Art lies at the mercy of his Captains when any War befalls him, and his Power ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected to their Fidelity; an evill ſo much the greater, as the Grandees of a Kingdom holding for a <hi>maxime,</hi> that the weakneſſe of their Prince is the moſt aſſured founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their Authority, would make no ſcruple of letting themſelves be overcome, when thereby they might hope for ſome advantage. Beſides it is not to be imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to what contempt he doth expoſe himſelf, whileſt he is in an Army which he knows not how to govern, how to quarter, how to give order in a March or a Battel. I have formerly ſaid, that that Prince is very unfortunate, who is neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated to make uſe of ſtrangers for his aſſiſtance. But what good ſucceſſe can he expect, who is not able to guide his own Subjects in War? To deal ingeniouſly, if the Army which he hath got together be the Body deſtinied for his defence, hee is then their head; but if he chance to be unable to do the Offices which belong to that part, his Army will fall to be like the body of a man, whoſe head by the many wounds it hath received, is no longer able to govern or direct the inferiour
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:56802:118"/>members. Amongſt the many wayes to make a Prince Maſter of this Art, no doubt, but the reading of ſuch Books as diſcourſe concerning Hiſtory and War, may be very uſefull, for by it may he obſerve the atchievements of great Captains and what orders they have followed in matters of fight: But yet the Practique part is that which in military affairs is much more advantagious. Neither ought a Prince to expect a War that he may accuſtome himſelf to the attaining of this ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit; for this is the time, when he muſt teach his Souldiers to execute that which himſelf had formerly learn'd. The exerciſing and training up of his Souldiers in time of Peace will be of a double advantage to him, for he not onely learns the manner of conducting them, but accuſtomes and habituates them to his own rules and conduct, and maketh himſelf beloved by them, ſo that when occaſion ſhall ſerve they will not eaſily leave or forſake him.</p>

                     <hi>Charles</hi> of <hi>Anſon</hi> was eſteemed a fortunate and good Souldier, but yet his cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit was much diminiſhed for his diſuſing his Souldiers to the exerciſe of their Arms in time of Peace. An Army not train'd up to feats of War in times of Peace, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not do any great actions in War when occaſion requires, ſaith <hi>Julius Caeſar;</hi> but on the contrary there are great hopes from them who are well Diſciplin'd. Upon this accompt it was, that he made ſo little difficulty to go meet with a handfull of men, <hi>Pompey</hi> and his vaſt Army in the Theſſalian Plains, they being for the moſt part untrain'd and without skill; ſo that he himſelf ſaid, he onely went to fight a head without a body. <hi>Scipio</hi> the Affricans greateſt care was in this manner, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually to exerciſe his Souldiers, that he might teach them to be victorious and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious. <hi>Philopaemon</hi> was much commended by antiquity, for that in times of Peace, he was diligently intent upon the exerciſing of his Souldiers for War, if oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions ſhould ſo happen, that there might be any ſudden need of them, many times would he lead them into the Field, and propoſe theſe and ſuch other queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to them. If the enemy (would he ſay) were incamped upon yonder Hill, who had the greater advantage by it, he, or me? how ſhould we aſſault him? what courſe were proper to be taken if he ſhould ſtay to attend us? If we ſhould be put to retreat, how ſhould we do it with moſt advantage? Thus he knew their opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and ſhewed them his own, which uſed them to a readineſſe of all manner of exerciſes. In fine, he who accuſtometh himſelf to this kind of action, may ſay what <hi>Camillus</hi> did to his in a great Battel which he had with the Tuſcans, at whoſe numbers his ſouldiers were aſtoniſhed: Companions and Fellow Souldiers (ſaid he) put not your ſelves to the trouble of doing any thing elſe, then what you have ſo often done before my face. Theſe few words gave them a confident aſſurance, and doubtleſſe a Prince whoever he be, ſhall baniſh all fear from his Souldiers, and much increaſe their Courages, when he hath train'd them up to the uſe of their Arms, and to the knowledge of what they ought to obſerve, he ſhall come to ſay thoſe or the like words unto them. Uſe makes perfection, maketh Cowards ſenceleſſe at the greateſt dangers, and enables them to do all things, who before could do nothing.</p>

For being come near about the <hi>Chef de Bay,</hi> they were received with a Volley of about fifty ſhort from the Point there; forty of which did execution upon them; eſpecially upon one, in which and Engliſh Collonel and divers of his Company were killed.

                  <p>But for all this, there was one Captain <hi>Braignant</hi> a Rochellois, in companie with them, who offered to attempt the paſſage in a ſmall Boat with Oares, croſſe the Kings Fleet, and over the Channels, to give thoſe of the Town information of what orders they were to obſerve: The Engliſh approoved of it, who making uſe of the darkneſs of the night, went and mingled himſelf with thoſe of the Kings Fleet under pretence of enquiring out for a Galliot, &amp; ſo well played his part, that he got into <hi>Rochel.</hi> Preſently the Rochellois made Bonefiers upon the tops of their Towers; The day following, they ſet up three Enſigns, one white, t'other red, &amp; the third Blew; the Engliſh did the like. The King ſeeing of it, preſently drew out his Armie into Battalia; which had bin during the eighth dayes laſt paſt much recuited, by the acceſſe of divers Volunteers, who had come in from all parts; and his Majeſty had the pleaſure to behold with what eagerneſſe, every one deſired to be engaged with the Enemies: Hereupon the Engliſh Fleet ſeeing the Sea ſmooth, and their Ships mooved with a fair Gale, came up toward his Majeſties Fleet, about Cannon di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; turned about their Ships and diſcharged their Broad-ſides, the like did the Rochellois; and the Kings Ships were not long before they ſet out to receive them, where they behaved themſelves with ſuch courage that the Engliſh had no reaſon to believe, they had leſſe reſolution now, then they had lately ſhewen at the Ile of <hi>Re;</hi> that which moſt of all troubled them was, they were not ignorant, with what obſtacles they were to encounter, in the Channels that they were to break through three Rayles, two of Veſſels floating on the Sea, and linked toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by Chains and Anchors; and a third ſeveral Veſſels filled with ſtones and ſunk before the Bank; the Channel too was covered all over, with Veſſels full of Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers and Voluntiers of the Nobility, all eager of fighting with them; beſides they were to avoyd the ſhot which would thunder in upon them from both ſides of the ſhore, by the Bank; al theſe difficulties made them diſpair of doing any good upon it, and that time the water was too low, for their Ships, in which their chief ſtrength conſiſted, and their deſign could not be excuſed, but at high-water, becauſe when the Sea began to ebb, their Veſſels of burden would remain as the mercy of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties great Guns, inſomuch that all things duely conſidered, they concluded it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for them to break thorough.</p>
                  <p>On the other ſide the Rochelois who had promiſed them to Sally out, and do miracles, did not appear at all, for they had found, that it would be impoſſible to make way thorough to the Bank, there being ſo many Veſſels full of Souldiers &amp; Volunteers, to be fought with; inſomuch that the Earl of Denbigh what out of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and what out of deſpair, reſolved to draw off: many complaints he made againſt the Rochellois, as that they had deceived the King his Maſter, in aſſuring him that it was eaſie to paſſe into their Port, and not informing him, of thoſe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacles, which he was to provide againſt, and with forces the King of <hi>France</hi> had a board his Ships, &amp; Veſſels to fight with his Souldiers; but yet al his complaints could not ſecure him, from being much blamed: all that he did, before his going off, was, he had ſent out a Fire-ſhip with Petards and the like, from which he expected great matters, as that it would burn all the Ships it came neer: but it happene to work ſooner then his enginers imagined; ſo that they being unable to get of the Barque which was faſtened to it, they burnt their Veſſels, and themſelves, without any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief or ſuccour.</p>

                     <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> ſuffered himſelf to be guided by the fair words of <hi>Themiſtocles,</hi> who being diſcontented with his own Countrey, perſwaded him to a War againſt <hi>Greece,</hi> where being arrived, he ſoon found <hi>Themiſtocles</hi> could not make good his word to him; whereby he came expoſed to many dangers; <hi>Themiſtocles</hi> indeed was ſo aſhamed of it, that he poiſoned himſelf but what did that advantage <hi>Artaxerxes</hi>'s, It neither defended him from the diſcredit and blame, nor ſaved him thoſe expences which he had bin at. In the ſame manner the Sieur de <hi>Chaumont</hi> one of our Kings Generals in <hi>Italy,</hi> let himſelf be guided by <hi>Bentivoglio,</hi> in the aſſalting of <hi>Boulognea,</hi> from whence he had bin baniſhed, upon the hopes he gave him, that the Citizens and No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility would revolt; but being come before it, he was forced to retire with diſhonor, all thoſe promiſes of <hi>Bentivoglio,</hi> which were founded more upon his paſſionate de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, than reaſon, being vaniſhed into that ayr which gave him the firſt conceipts of them. I might add for another reaſon, the facility wherewith a people revolted, do ſubmit to their ſoveraigns, when they find themſelves reduced to an impoſſibility of executing their deſignes.

                  <p>THE Piety of a King avails much in the obtaining of Victorie. Who can doubt it, ſeeing God is the Authour of them, and that Piety is a charm which capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vates him as the Royal Prophet hath ſaid, To hear the Prayers of them who fear him, and to defend them from their enemies? Antiquity uſed to ſay (according to <hi>Plutarch</hi>) that Fortune gave to <hi>Demetrius</hi> thoſe Towns which he took in Nets of Gold: <hi>Mercurius Treſmegiſtus</hi> ſaith, that he whoſe Piety puts him into Gods protection, is not eaſily ſurpriſed by any ambuſh, and <hi>St. Auguſtine</hi> writeth in his Book <hi>de Civit. Dei,</hi> That the Romans had not been Maſters of the Univerſe by Force and Prudence, but by the Virtue and Piety which they practiſed: The Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctories they obtained being the rewards of their deſerts; indeed Juſtice and Piety are the ſtrongeſt weapons a Soveraign can imploy to ſuppreſſe his enemies: And if any one ask the reaſon of it, I ſhall onely alledge this, that Piety renders them worthy to obtain Victories from the hand of God, who hath promiſed in a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand places of holy Writ to imploy his power in the behalf of thoſe Kings which are righteous. And how often hath God made the Winds and Tempeſts to fight their Battels who have been carefull to walk in his ways? How often hath he ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned inacceſſible places to them, and calmed the Sea for their ſakes? Hath it not been often ſeen that an handfull of men by his aſſiſtance have brought ſtrong Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to confuſion, and became Maſters of places thought to be impregnable. To ſpeak truly, nothing is ſo ſtrong, ſo powerfull, ſo invincible, nor ſo generous as that valour which marching under the Banners of Chriſtian Piety, ſubmiteth its ſelf to Gods protection, the true ſtrength of all Chriſtian Princes: And as it were in vain to ſeek for Light without the Sun, Water without Fountains or Rivers, and heat without fire; ſo it would be ridiculous to expect true ſtrength from any other then his protection, who is the God of Battels. The more a Prince is in favour with him, the more courage will he give him, eſpecially when he fighteth for his glory, and this is a maxime which may ſerve for a foundation to the happineſſe of all Kings, and who ſo obſerveth it not, buildeth his deſigns upon the ſand. <hi>Alphon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> King of <hi>Sicily</hi> and <hi>Arragon</hi> taught his ſon <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> in ſuch terms as were ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry proper to be learned by all young Princes in their infancy. It was then when he ſent him to revenge the injuries, which he had received from the Florentines, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold his words:</p>

                  <p>My ſon (ſaid he) That which I chiefly command you, is, Truſt not ſo much upon your ſouldiers courages, as upon your hopes of aſſiſtance from Heaven, learn to day from me, Victory is not the effect of the Diſcipline or induſtry of men, but of Gods power, who is the judge of Battels. The Military Art can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver aſſure of an happy ſucceſſe in our deſigns, if we be once defective in making God our friend by the Piety and Innocence of our actions. In fine, all the max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ims of War, not link'd with the Laws of God are weak foundations; and all the fortunes which are not grounded upon him, who turns the Globe of the Earth with his hand, are nearer to deſtruction then advancement. The Greeks though brought up in the darkneſſe of errour, did they not deſign to teach us, when in their fables it was ſaid, that <hi>Mercury</hi> who was adored by them for the God of Prudence, was nurſed by the hours? For to what end was it, if not to teach their people that all humane wiſedome, if not regulated nor ſuſtained by the meaſures of Heaven could not have any nouriſhment or ſubſiſtance.</p>

There preſently did ariſe great diſſentions between them, but the prevalent party, impriſoned ſome, and executed others, whom they found diſpoſed to an accommodation; inſomuch that from that time the poor people were ready to periſh by famine, and durſt not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of it.

There need no other reaſon for it, but onely this Paſſion is naturally the Miſtreſs of popular ſpirits, which are neither capable of reaſon or generouſneſs the two known cauſes of civility, modeſty and valour: Experience too hath made it evident that they who are born with narrow low hearts are terrified at the leaſt dangers, and care not what evils they commit if they have but the power to defend them. It is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of paſſion, either to yeild to ſoon, or not at all; and by the impetuouſneſſe of their motion it is, that many people have choſen after the ſuffering of a thouſand miſeries, to dye within their City wals, rather then open their Gates, to their beſie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers. <hi>Calagurva</hi> a City of <hi>Spain,</hi> being beſieged by <hi>Pompey,</hi> the inhabitants of it, were ſo obſtinate in defence of their Walls in <hi>Sertorius</hi> his behalf, that after they had eaten up all their living creatures, they were ſo ſenceleſly cruel, as to kill their Wives and Children, that they might eat them: And the <hi>Saguntines</hi> too, who were of the ſame Nation after they had ſuffered the utmoſt extremities, turned their rage upon their own ſelves, inſomuch that their fame became a proverb, for having no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing left to eat, they made a great fier in the publike place, where they firſt burnt, whatever they eſteemed rich, and then threw in themſelves, chooſing rather to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh in the flames, then to let the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> become Maſters of their Town and Perſons, rather to follow the impetuouſneſſe of that fury which tormented them, then to be guided by reaſon, which would have taught them, that it had bin no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famy to yield to a Conqueror, when he hath reduced ſuch as reſiſt him, to an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibility of eſcaping.</p>

They went to wait upon his Eminency at <hi>Rouſay,</hi> at the Quarter <hi>de la Bergery,</hi> where they were in conference full two hours with him, after which every one gueſſed by their cheerfulneſſe that they were very well contented, they deſired a ſafe conduct to wait upon him two dayes after in the ſame place, which was not denied them, and being come thither they teſtified a great reſolution in the people to deliver them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves up to his Majeſties mercy, ſeeing that notwithſtanding their Rebellion, he had been pleaſed to let them live in the exerciſe of their Religion, the injoyment of their goods, and withall the preſervation of their Walls; the Cardinal ſent them back to the King, whom they found upon the Bank they were afraid to appear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Majeſty, but being brought into his preſence they caſt themſelves at his feet, and begged his pardon and mercy with as many apparent ſubmiſſions, as could have been deſired.

Thoſe campes which are garded with moſt circumſpection, are the moſt ſecure, and he who is not alwayes in a way of defence, puts himſelf into eminent danger; That General who lets his forces ſleep without good gard, commits the care of them and their lives to fortune. <hi>Iphicrates</hi> one of the moſt famous Captains of <hi>Athens</hi> was far enough from committing this fault, for his Souldiers kept the ſame gard in peace, and with the ſame ſtricttneſſe as in War, their arms being alwayes ready by them to fight.

By this means after the ſhame of a rout, he will not be forced to ſay, I did not think there had been any thing to fear. If a General hath reaſon at any time to be upon his gard, more eſpecially ought he to be ſo then, when there are propoſitions of peace in treaty; for one of the moſt uſual wiles, which great Captains uſe, is that of propoſing ſome treaty whereby they might make advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage.

                  <p>ONE of the remedies which the Rochellois uſed to relieve their neceſſities, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially after the Engliſh were returned, was to turn out all the unneceſſary mouthes; they found means by the help of a dark night and in a tempeſt, which had broken in ſunder ſome of the floating Veſſels which ſtopped the mouth of the Bank, to paſſe a Barque laden with women, which the Kings veſſels then in gard did not perceive time enough to prevent: but this was the onely time they could procure that advantage, but on the contrary, their inſolency being come to the height, they forced the Kings Juſtice Severely to puniſh ſuch as attempted to ſave themſelves by Land; about the end of <hi>Auguſt</hi> above three hundred perſons of all ages and both ſexes came out by the Channel at low water, and being got to Land, fell to eating of roots and herbs with ſuch greedineſſe, that it was eaſie to judge how much the inhabitants of the Town were neceſſitated by famine. They had been fit objects with compaſſion, had they been leſſe inſolent; but as nothing except ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity it ſelf could bring them to their duties, ſo the Sieurs de <hi>Brisfac,</hi> de <hi>Fourille</hi> and the other Captains of the gards when they lighted on them, forced them back into he Town, to augment the famine of the inhabitants. This juſt ſeverity was oftentimes uſed towards them, by which means their miſeries were ſuch, that having neither bread, pulſe, nor any thing uſually edible, they found out an invention to boil Beefs-hides in tallow &amp; ſuch other things. They were oftentimes ſeen to go into the Salt-pits to gather herbs and cockles, and ſuch other ſtuff as they could frie, which they preſently devoured as delicates. They eat bread made of thiſtle-roots, and their hunger not ſo ſatisfied, turning into fury came to that paſſe, that they eat dead bodies, and ſome perſwaded the mothers to embrew their hands in the blood of their innocent Babes for their preſent nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>

It is true for their greater confuſion the men were driven back again naked, and the Women in their ſmocks forcing them with forks and lathes to return: as for thoſe who attempted to paſſe the trenches in the night, or by any other deviſe, they were all hanged without mercy, if it were their misfortunes to be diſcovered, becauſe ſome of them hand been taken with Letters and Tickets to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten on the relief from <hi>England,</hi> and this prudent <hi>Severity</hi> was at laſt the true caſe of their repentance.</p>

                  <p>IT is an equitable cruelty, to hinder the beſieged from running out of a Town, when their neceſſities begin to preſſe upon them. If the War be lawfull their deaths muſt needs be juſt. It is true in point of ſieges the inhabitants are firſt to be gained by kindneſſe, but when perſwaſions will not do, force and rigour ought to be made uſe of, and this ought to be done with the leſſe difficulty, in regard the death of Rebels doth well ſuit with Juſtice and the publick good. Famine is one of the chief weapons which forceth a Town in a long ſiege. It is that which takes them, where the Artillery cannot make breaches or ruines enough to force a ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render. Now as this Famine is augmented by their number, he who ſhall ſuffer them to get out and avoid the neceſſity which preſſe upon them, acteth againſt himſelf, and depriveth himſelf of the moſt aſſured means to take them. The more people that are in a beſieged Town, the ſooner will their victuals be conſumed, and they ſooner reduced to famine, and then follows death in its hideous and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed viſage, producing every day ſpectacles of horrour, which they who have any reaſon and find a neceſſities of being forced, had much rather ſurrender then behold; famine makes the weapons fall out of their hands.

                  <p>THE uſual rule in Sieges, is to keep the beſieged cloſe up, and to deprive them of all kind of liberty; for by conſequence, liberty which is one of the moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfull things in mans life being once ſtopped, becomes very diſpleaſing, and is a ſufficient reaſon to perſwade thoſe who are under that reſtraint, to do any thing for the inlargement of it. However this rule admitteth of ſome exception, and ought not to be uſed when a beſieged people pretend to ſow any grain, or the like about their City Walls; For as the Corn which they put into the earth doth not a little diminiſh their main ſtock, ſo the freedome which is permitted them, thus to caſt it away, ſerveth the ſooner to bring them to want and famine, and ſo to ſurrender. The chief end in long ſieges, is to famiſh the beſieged, and as the ſowing of their ground doth not a little contribute thereunto, ſo Prudence forbiddeth that they ſhould be hindred in their work; and indeed commandeth that they ſhould rather be invited and allured to it, by winking at them if they attempt it.

It is true they made fewer then had been ſeen in any ſo great ſiege, in hopes that the Engliſh would come and force open the Bank but however ſome they made, and thoſe great ones, but were repulſed with loſſe, It was the <hi>Sieur de Fouquierres</hi> miſhap to be taken Priſoner by them in one of their Sallies, which they made about the beginning of the year; there were divers of theirs too taken, which were kept in durance for exchanges, if occaſion ſhould be, and they of the City had notice given unto them, that in caſe they did him any inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, his Majeſty would cauſe all his Priſoners of theirs to be hanged without mercy; ſo they dealt civilly with him, and when their Victuals began to grow ſcarce, they permitted one of his ſervants to bring him ſome every day from the Camp. Their inſolency likewiſe carried them to make ſeveral Sallies by Sea, eſpecially upon the arrival of thoſe ſhips from <hi>Bourdoaux,</hi> which they attempted to have fired, but they had never any good ſucceſſe in them, onely once they took a ſmall Galliot which belonged to the <hi>Sieur de Thoyras;</hi> the Cardinals care and diligence, ſetting ſuch a watch over them, that hardly-a man could peep out, but he was preſently diſcovered.</p>

                  <p>THoſe Sallies which the beſieged make upon an Army lying before them, are ſtill accompanied with danger to themſelves, for the leaſt loſſe of their Souldiers is of great concernment; becauſe they being once gone, it is difficult to have a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruit or relief of others. The valour indeed which they have opportunity of ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in ſuch incounters, may perchance quell the reſolutions of the Beſiegers; eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially if the place be well ſtored and likely to receive freſh ſupplies; but that not being ſo, the Beſiegers by ſtanding ſtill in their Forts and Works, and keeping good guard in their Trenches, will be ſure every time to leſſen their number of ſome few, and in fine reduce them to none at all. <hi>Philip de Commines</hi> ſaith, all Sallies made without neceſſity are to be blamed; for they cannot without it be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowable, that which ſometimes maketh to vanquiſh againſt hope, by the cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:56802:123"/>which it infuſethinto the moſt cowardly, for there is not any danger which they are not eaſily perſwaded toattempt who are convinced of the inevitableneſs of their preſent death. This is that which all thoſe who are beſieged ought to conſider; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they make a ſalley: now as for the Beſiegers, they have onely two ways to avoid all misfortunes, the firſt, the well ordering of their works, the ſecond, the good watch of thoſe works. If the Trenches are well contrived, not any where at too great diſtance from the Town, if they flank one another, if they be high enough to ſhelter the foot, if their Parapets be Faulcon proof, if they be ſo well fortified by Forts and Redouts, from diſtance to diſtance; if they be large enough to fight in; and ſo diſpoſed, that one be not ſurpriſed behind they will bring great matters to paſſe; they ought alſo to be lined with Souldiers, well accoutred, well diſciplined, and ſuch as wil be careful to keep good watch day and night, neither is it leſſe needful, to place Sentinels, upon the Avennues, and all along upon the Trenches; and at laſt when the Enemie doth appear, then is the time to repel force by Force, then ought the moſt reſolute of the Souldiers, be placed in Front, to ſuſtain the charge, as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in that quarter, which is neereſt the Town, becauſe they who bear the firſt brunt, are the men that do the work; and upon whom all the reſt doth depend, and in thoſe places it is, that the firſt aſſaults are alwayes made: But above all, he who commandeth in the Trenches, ought alwayes to have Forces in a readineſſe from the out-guards, for ſeconding courage with numbers doth much conduce to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelling of an Enemie, with advantage: and if he find that thoſe who are up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the guard, be not either proper or able to ſuſtain a charge, if the Enemie ſhould come out, then ought he to place them in the ſtrongeſt Redouts, from whence it will be more difficult to force them, until recruits ſhall come up; and this was the order which <hi>Caeſar</hi> obſerved in beſieging the City of <hi>Alexia,</hi> as is to be ſeen in his Commentaries.</p>

The Sentinel of the Caſtle, gave notice to the Count de <hi>Clermont,</hi> that he ſaw eight or ten Horſe eye the Caſtle, in ſuch a manner, that he conceived them to be Enemies: preſently the Count and thoſe that were with him, iſſued out in their doublets and hoſe, with their Swords and Piſtols, and fell upon them. Theſe Horſe-men as ſoon as ever they perceived them made as if they fled towards a Wood, where they had left their fifty Muſqueteers in Ambuſh; being come up to them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they faced about, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging all together upon the Noblemen, who purſued them, within Piſtol ſhot, they killed twelve of them; The Baron <hi>d'Ambre</hi> being then with the Count de <hi>Clermont,</hi> ſeeing his Cornet killed, vowed he would be revenged of them for his death, and turning about again to charge them, he was in an inſtant ſo ſurrounded that he ſaw it was impoſſible to eſcape: he asked them if ten thouſand Crowns would ſave his life, they told him no, and bid him remember <hi>Montpellier.</hi> This ſeemed onely to be a ſtratagem of War, but their cruelty was in proceſſe evidently
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:56802:124"/>to be ſeen, for not contented with this advantage, they cut off the noſes and ears of all they took.

Thoſe of his faction in <hi>Montauban,</hi> where no leſſe inſolent, there they forced out of their City, the Lieutenant <hi>Paxticulier,</hi> the Doyen of the Senechil, two Councellours and the Lieutenant General, and preſently perſwaded the people to riſe. Thoſe of <hi>Niſmez, Coſne, Saint Sever, Saint Frigue,</hi> and divers other places, of <hi>Languedoc, Vivarets,</hi> and <hi>Dauphine,</hi> did the like, neither were theſe the onely Provinces, in which they had their Intelligencers at work. Moſieur the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal, had bin acquainted, about the beginning of <hi>March,</hi> whileſt his Majeſty was at <hi>Paris,</hi> that certain Gentlemen of his party did endeavor to make factions and diviſions in <hi>Limaſin</hi> againſt the Kings ſervice, he not ignorant that ſuch fiers ought to be extinguiſhed on their firſt births, ſent the Mareſchal de <hi>Schomberg,</hi> Lieutenant General; of that Province, to take order in it, who no leſſe prudent then valorous, ſoon diſſipated them, that not a man durſt ſhew his head. About the ſame time, he had alſo by ſome device or other gained one <hi>Le Parc,</hi> Son to one of the Captains of a Gate at <hi>Callais,</hi> to deliver the Town to the Engliſh by letting them in at a Baſtion, which was ſomwhat decayed, and delivering them up the old Caſtle, where there was only one old Souldier of his acquaintance, who lay in gard.

                  <p>REbels at their firſt riſing may perchance get ſome advantages, either by intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligences in ſtrong Towns or ſurpriſal of thoſe which are but ill kept, but in fine they do moulter away and are reduced to nothing. It were to be wiſhed, that before they attempted any thing, they did but know, what is the true Reaſon hereof which it this, they are to ſeek for thoſe things which are neceſſary to continue a War, with good ſucceſſe, for the beginning there need little or nothing, but thoſe beginnings muſt of neceſſity terminate in diſaſters, if he who is the firſt mover, have not ſtore of Forces, and power to recruite them, if he be not furniſhed with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert Officers and Treaſures, if he have not very good intelligences with the Lords &amp; Princes bordering upon thoſe places which he pretendeth to aſſault, &amp; laſtly if him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf too, be not endewed with a ſoul &amp; courage truly great that he ought of neceſſity to have Forces and power to recuit himſelf, cannot be doubted, becauſe otherwiſe, his ſoveraign will preſently cruſh him, the inconſtancie of his Souldiers will by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſbanding leave him naked; and ſickneſſes will help to take away ſome too, ſo that in fine he will be reduced to nothing, if he cannot repair his loſſes by recruits, and new freſh Regiments. That which gave the Romans ſuch advantage over other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, was, firſt their diſcipline of War, but ſecondly their Numbers; now the means uſed to get ſuch great Armies, was to exerciſe thoſe Enemies whom they had over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, in their Militia, as <hi>Tacitus</hi> obſerveth on the Life of the Emperour <hi>Claudian,</hi> and on the other ſide the Lacedemonians, and Athenians, not entertaining any Strangers, though by them ſubjugated, never brought any great conſiderable Armies for number into the field, and conſequently could never attain unto ſo great an Empire. Next to the great numbers of Souldiers, which he ought to have, comes Treaſures, without which it is impoſſible to prevent an Army from wanting victuals, clothes, and neceſſaries, and by conſequence from disbanding, <hi>Quintus Flaminius</hi> ſeeing <hi>Philopoemon</hi> Captain of the Grecians, with a great Army, both of Horſe and
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:56802:124"/>Foot, but without any mony, laughed at him; he hath indeed, quoth he, ſtore of Legs and Arms, but no Belly; meaning, by like, that he wanted wherewithal to feed them. <hi>Caeſar</hi> how great a Souldier ſoever, and how valiant ſoever his Souldiers were, brake open the Treaſure Gate at <hi>Rome,</hi> contrary to <hi>Motellus the Tribunes</hi> will: for he wiſely foreſaw, that it would be imposſible to give a good account of the War, without he were provided with ſtore of Treaſures. Next of all I come to expect Officers who are not leſſe needful, becauſe they are as the ſoul of the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers; and as it is true that a Body cannot move without it's ſoul, neither can any Souldiers do any thing conſiderable, if not conducted by the example of their Commanders and inſtructed how, where and when, they ought to fight. And then ought he to hold good intelligence too with the Grandees, and thoſe places which border upon that part which he deſigneth to attaque, for otherwiſe, his Convoyes will be ſtopped, every day will make ſome hole in his Coat, and they will ſerve for retreits to his Enemies to contrive Ambuſhes and deſigns againſt him. For this Reaſon it was that <hi>James</hi> King of <hi>Scotland,</hi> contriving to make War upon <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth King of <hi>England,</hi> was careful to hold intelligence, with the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> who elſe might have endangered and troubled his Forces; &amp; that <hi>Hannibal</hi> aſſaulting the Romans; firſt made ſure of the <hi>Spaniards, French,</hi> and <hi>Africans;</hi> and that the <hi>Romans</hi> bending their powers againſt <hi>Philip of Macedon,</hi> firſt ſent their Ambaſſadors, to make a League with <hi>Ptolomei</hi> King of <hi>Egypt.</hi> Laſtly, and moſt eſpecially he himſelf ought to be of a genius and courage, every way truely extraordinary, for every day he muſt be expoſed to new dangers; the ſucceſſe of the greateſt part of his affairs, will depend upon his own prudence and addreſſe; the leaſt diſtruſt or fear that ſhall appear in him will drive away whole troops from him; extraordinarie deſigns re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring a proportionate conduct to carrie them on, in regard Revolts have the more need of Fortunes aſſiſtance, becauſe they are the moſt hazardous exploits in which a man can ingage, never any mean Low heart arrived to any good ſuccuſſe or Fortune by them. Theſe are the chief things neceſſary for a great enterpriſe, and they that engage themſelves, without theſe, do raſhly run the hazard of their own deſtruction: It is only by the want of theſe ſupports that ſo many Authors of Revolt have gone out with ſhame and confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>

                  <p>THE Duke of <hi>Trimouille</hi> was a perſon very moderate, and temperate in all his actions, his very youth was without heat and paſſion, neither had he any of the pride and inſolency which is too uſual with thoſe of his birth; and as moderate ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber men, are more deſirous of inſtruction then the contrary ſort, ſo he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented to be guided by the hand of God; yet would he ſee the truth, and firſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of certain ſcruples and difficulties which did ariſe, in which till then, he could not be ſatisfied: but having bin ſo happy, as to be inſtructed by the Cardinal, it was the eaſier for him to ſee and leave his error, in regard the incomparable ſoul of this grand Miniſter, did ſo clearly evince the Catholique truth to him, and his own error, as himſelf hath ſince often acknowledged. It was not riches nor honor which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced him to change his Religion: for he was both born rich and great: but it was the only knowledg of Truth which perſwaded him to it, neither did he that, until a moſt particular and exact ſatisfaction in all things. The King was overjoyed at the newes of it, never was any ſpoil or Trophee of an Enemy ſo welcome, as this Victory, and the more to teſtifie his real joy for it; his Majeſty promiſed him, that the next Feaſt he would receive the Communion with him; as alſo the <hi>Sieur de la Curee,</hi> being diſmiſſed of his Charge of Maſter <hi>de Camp,</hi> which his age had made him uncapable any longer to perform, his Majeſty honoured him with it, ſtudying to ſhew to all his Subjects, in his perſon, how dear their ſalvations was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him.</p>

                  <p>IF it be a work of Juſtice to chaſtiſe rebellious Heretiques by the ſword, it is no leſſe charitable to labour for their converſion by letting them ſee the truth; for the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter diſcovering of which, much charity, clearneſſe of ſpirit, and profound Doctrine are required: a Soul not well informed inſtead of allaying, raiſeth more doubts; inſomuch that knowledge hath as great a part in the Church, as the Sun in the Fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mament, and juſt as it is difficult to reſtore a Traveller into his right way, during the night, untill the Sun appear to inſtruct him where he is, ſo neither can a man of underſtanding be diſabuſed, unleſſe it be by Doctrine, at whoſe light a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Genius</hi> makes him perceive, that he is at the brink of a Precipice, and far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the right way to Heaven. But amongſt thoſe for whoſe converſion it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite to labour, no doubt but the chief men are firſt to be attempted, for if the Stars continually follow the motions of the Heavens, unto which they are affixed; it is in like manner as common for men of mean quality, to follow as well the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion as the intereſt of the Grandees.

For my part, I hold it for certain that it will be no more difficulty to reclaim an Heretique Faction, who ſhould rebel without a powerfull Commander: But I likewiſe think it neceſſary beſides Doctrinal inſtructions, not to ſpare either money or dignity for the gaining of thoſe, whoſe Birth renders them capable of ſuch qualities.

This once done, his Majeſty viſited all the Quarters of the Army, that he might put every thing in good order, and got himſelf an immortal glory by his travel, labour, and diligence, by thoſe dexterous orders which he diſpatched both as to the Sea and Land, by his raiſing of Batteries, deſigning of Plat-forms, and levelling of the Cannon with his own hand. Upon Saturday the thirtieth, the Engliſh Fleet came up to the Road of the <hi>Chef de Bay</hi> and ſome few of them came before to draw out the French to fight; but the Kings Veſſels having order not to ſtir, becauſe they were onely to hinder the Paſſage into <hi>Rochel,</hi> not one of them moved on Anchor, onely both parts exchanged ſome Broad-ſides, and the King being in perſon upon one of the Batteries, cauſed about thirty to bee lovelled at them, which did not a little indamage them.</p>

                  <p>AFter the Engliſh had ſtood in this Poſture two dayes they ſent out between Sunday even, and Munday morn, 10 or 12 floating Petards to ſet fire on the Kings ſhips. The Compoſition of thoſe Petards was of Lattin filled with Powder, laid upon certain peeces of Timber, croſſe which there was a ſpring, which touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any Veſſel would flie off and give fire to the Petards; but onely one took ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, which did no great hurt, onely caſt water into the ſhip, and that was all, the reſt being taken by the Kings Boats; their Petards were anſwered by good ſtore of Cannon from the Kings ſhips, yet their Fleet continued ſtill in the ſame poſture, inſomuch that many beleeved that they would either return that day, without any more ado, or elſe land their men. Now as he who commands an Army is obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to foreſee all accidents, and to prevent them; ſo the King commanded the Duke of <hi>Angouleſm,</hi> and the Marſhal <hi>de Scomberg</hi> to guard the Point <hi>de Coreille,</hi> and the Duke <hi>de la Trimoville,</hi> and the <hi>Comte de Alets,</hi> to ſtand their charge with the Light-horſe and the Cavalry, and took his own ſtation at the Point of the <hi>Chef de Bay</hi> with ſome foot and divers of the Nobility, which he intended to defend in his own perſon. His Majeſty further gave order to ſeveral Voluntiers to go aboard
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:56802:126"/>the ſhips with his Souldiers; and which was done in ſight of the Engliſh Fleet, which had no great mind that day to ingage; but the day following being the 30 of <hi>Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> and conſidering that the reputation of their Maſter was too much ingaged in the defence of the Rochelois, for them to go away without doing of any thing; and having the Wind favourable, they hoiſed Sails, made ready, and came up to the Kings Fleet, which preſently met them in good order. The fight began at 6 of the Clock, and in about four hours time they diſcharged between them near 5000 great ſhot, but never came nearer one another then Cannon diſtance. The Kings Fleet commanded by the Commander <hi>de Valencay,</hi> did as much as could be deſired; and though the Engliſh had the wind of them; yet were they but ill treated by the Cannon; one of their great ſhips being ſo torn, that they were forced to retire to the Iſle of <hi>Oye</hi> to mend her.</p>

                  <p>IN the mean while the King being in the Batteries of the <hi>Chef de Bay,</hi> which he had but raiſed two days before, cauſed his Cannons to be diſcharged by his parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Order, without the leaſt fear of the danger whereunto he did expoſe himſelf, in regard of the many Bullets which fell at his feet, and came very near him, he took a great delight to ſee his Guns do that execution which he intended, the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments fight for him, and the Engliſh betray their fear of his preſence, good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, and courage. And was it not much more glorious for him, to give order for the ſtanding of this aſſault, and to be himſelf preſent in it by offering his life to God, then to have been in his Chamber at <hi>Paris,</hi> where thoſe of <hi>Marillac</hi>'s fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction would have ſtaied him? Was it not a greater pleaſure to him, to behold the Sea all on fire, bringing flaming Veſſels to his feet, as if they did him homage, and to command in his own perſon amidſt the Batteries, then to have been idle in the <hi>Louvre?</hi> In my ſenſe he had been as much too blame to have been at <hi>Paris</hi> whiles theſe affairs were acting, as it was now glorious to ſee him here reducing Hereſie to his obedience. And this was as much as was done the firſt day.</p>
                  <p>The next morning the wind being ſtill fair for the Engliſh, they ſet their Sails, began to ſhoot but durſt not come nearer the Kings Fleet, then before; they were anſwered in the ſame language, and for four hours together, the Ayr ſeemed to be all on fire. The little more which they did worth obſervation was this, they ſent 9 Fire-ſhips, ſeconding them with Ships filled with Stones and full of dung; to which they had ſet fire with intent that the ſmoke of it driven by the Wind to the Kings Fleet might cover them, and give the Engliſh means to paſſe the Channel. But his Majeſties ſmall Boats went to the Fire-ſhips at the mercy of the great ſhot, ſeized on them, and diverted their execution, onely loſing one man, without any greater hurt, and the Veſſels which followed them durſt not advance; which the Engliſh Fleet ſeeing, and how much the Forts did trouble them, they drew off to the Road not without great diſoder, leaving the Rochelois to deſpair. Neither was this the onely miſ-fortune that befell them; for at that very inſtant ſo great a ſtorm aroſe, that they were forced to let themſelves be carried at the mercy of the wind. The Engliſh finding how unlikely they were to do any good, propoſed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der hand that ſome accommodation might be made; they thought it would bee more advantagious to retreat after the making of a Peace, then to run the hazards of a worſe ſucceſſe. Monſieur the Cardinal deſired his Majeſty to obſerve that his onely aim being the taking of <hi>Rochel,</hi> this accommodation would much contribute to it; for then the Rochelois would remain without any ſuccour at all, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced him to give ear to thoſe Propoſals which ſhould be made. But their ſouls being yet exaſperated, the Peace could not ſo ſuddenly be reſolved on, and all the conferences which were had to that purpoſe, ended in a Ceſſation of Arms for ſome few dayes.</p>

                  <p>ALbeit, they who have been once vanquiſhed in War, may recover the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage which they have loſt, either when their forces are recruited with a ſufficient ſtrength, or when ſhame ſhall excite their courages, yet ſo it is, that when neither of theſe two conditions happen, there is a great reaſon to apprehend the ſucceſſe of their ſecond attempt. Fortune hath ſometimes ſmiled on thoſe, who formerly never ſaw but her frowns, but after ſhe hath been once and again diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, it will be needfull to imploy more force and greater courage; for ſhe is a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed friend to the bold and prudent. Great Routs are attended with dangerous conſequences, whence <hi>Titus Livy,</hi> ſpeaking of a certain faction of <hi>Marcellus,</hi> againſt <hi>Hannibal</hi> at <hi>Nola,</hi> ſaid that it was much more difficult to worſt an Army fleſhed in Victory, then that which begins to loſe its credit. He gives the ſame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for that victory, which the Romans under the command of Conſul <hi>Manlius,</hi> obtained againſt the Gauls in <hi>Aſia,</hi> where he ſaith, that as Victories do heighten the courage of the Victorious, ſo they do much abate that of the vanquiſhed; and withall the Victorious are deſirous onely to fight as may be obſerved in the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Pompey</hi>'s Souldiers after the advantage which they had of <hi>Caeſar</hi> as <hi>Plutarch</hi> reporteth upon the life of <hi>Pompey;</hi> whereas they who are worſted, are hard to be drawn to the Battel; for being ſeiſed with their uſual fear, and the moſt part of them fighting by conſtraint; they behave themſelves with ſo little mettle, that they are eaſily overcome a ſecond time. Thus the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> returning from <hi>Italy</hi> after the Battel of <hi>St. Laurence,</hi> to command thoſe French Troops which had been rallied and new liſted, writ to his Majeſty that he had more ado to put them in heart and courage, then to beat the victorious enemy, and therefore he judged it neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary before he hazarded a ſecond Battel, to cure them of their firſt baffle by getting ſome little advantage upon the enemy, an advice which he well knew how to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute, as he did in the taking of <hi>Calais, Guines, &amp; Thionville.</hi>

                  <p>THE Ceſſation of Arms being expired, the Engliſh to teſtifie it was not out of fear, that they retreited, or had made thoſe propoſals, renewed the fight on the twenty third of <hi>October,</hi> which laſted above two houres, yet all this while had they not the courage to come up to his Majeſties Fleet; whereupon thoſe French who were with them reſolved to ſend ſome Deputies to the King in their behalf, to caſt themſelves at the Kings Feet, and to emplore his mercy; Firſt of all they ſent four to Monſieur the Cardinal, who humbly requeſted him, that he would be pleaſed to obtain the Kings favour and grace for them, which they heartily beſeeched, with all real acknowledgements of their faults. The Cardinal anſwered them, he would ſpeak to his Majeſty concerning it, and commanded they ſhould be kindly entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and put into ſome place apart, that they might not enter into diſcourſe with any one; The King was eaſily perſwaded to grant them what they demanded, the Cardinal having told him, how neceſſary it was to win them off from the Engliſh, which if he could once bring to paſſe, the Engliſh would withdraw of their own accord, and leave <hi>Rochel,</hi> to ſhift for it ſelf. He then acquainted them how his Majeſty had granted them the mercy and favour, which they had beſeeched of him, yet however he thought good, that two of them, ſhould remain with him, whom he would make uſe of as I ſhall hereafter declare, for the regaining of the Rochelois, to their former duties and obedience. Thoſe Rebellious mutineers when they ſaw there was no hopes of ſuccour from the Engliſh, and that they died by thouſands of the famine, made divers propoſals of accommodation. Hereupon his eminency told them how that thoſe of their party on board the Engliſh Fleet had withdrawn themſelves, and had obtain'd the Kings pardon; that the Engliſh finding it impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to force the Bank &amp; relieve them, had interceded for them; that they had more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over ſent <hi>Montague</hi> to make propoſals of peace unto his Majeſty: who had kindly received him, that thereupon he was return'd into <hi>England,</hi> to encline the King his Maſter, to hearken to an accommodation, and that things being thus, they had no other hopes, but, to die by famine, if they had not recourſe to his Majeſties mercy by a true confeſſion and humble acknowledgment of their faults. This news gave an Allarum to the whole City, The diſcreeteſt of them repreſented to the reſt how the Rich did now begin to dye of famine: as well as the poor, having ſold the greateſt part of their victuals to thoſe that had none, upon hopes of the Engliſh relief, that death made an harveſt of them, that ſince the laſt ſix moneths there had died between eight and ten thouſand of famine, inſomuch that not having where withal to bury the dead, and indeed having hardly any people ſtrong enough to make their graves, or carry them, inſomuch that they were forced to draw them with cords into the Church-yards, and there to let them rot, that diverſe had been ſeen to crawl with much ado to the Church-yards and there lay down and dye; hereupon the reſt of the people languiſhing, and touched to the quick, with the remembrance, or indeed the preſent image of ſo many horrible ſpectacles, reſolved to try their fortune to appeaſe, if poſſible, the Kings juſt indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by imploring his mercy: They entreated the Sieur <hi>Arnoult</hi> to procure a ſafe conduct that they might ſend their Deputies to his Majeſty, which upon his Requeſt was graunted; But his Majeſty would that they ſhould firſt make their propoſals to Monſieur the Cardinal, to whom they went with an unſpeakable joy, &amp; therupon this grand Miniſter producing thoſe Deputies which he had kept to that purpoſe, let them diſcourſe with one another who having aſſured them that they themſelves had obtained the Kings pardon, repreſented to them that they likewiſe had nothing now to hope for, if they did not totally ſubmit themſelves to the diſcretion of his Majeſties mercy; but miſerably to dye by famine, his Majeſty being reſolved never to depart from thence, till he was Maſter of the Town.</p>
                  <p>They were much ſurpriſed at this newes having not heard of it till then, yet they were inſolent enough to make propoſitions of peace, ſtill reliſhing of their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer mutinie. This grand Miniſter declared to them, they muſt not think of any other
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:56802:128"/>conditions, than abſolutely to ſubmit to his Majeſties will, but however promiſed them that he would employ his utmoſt power in their behalf; ſo they returned pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing to diſpoſe their Fellow-citizens to it, as much as in them lay, teſtifying as much ſatisfaction and joy as they who are reprieved from the Galleys. After this meeting they publiſhed all over the Town, how kindly the Cardinal had entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them with aſſurances he had given them to employ his intereſt with his Majeſty to obtain the ſame grace for them, which he had for thoſe with the Engliſh, whoſe Deputies they had ſpoken with, conjuring every one to accept of it: The height of that miſery to which they were reduced did at laſt quaſh their mutinies, although ſome of their Miniſters not ignorant that power was the worthieſt ſtipend of their inſolencies, animated them by the hopes of glory, which they ſhould obtain by dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the liberties of their Religion; ſo they could not preſently reſolve to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render to the Kings mercy, but propoſed to make a general peace for all thoſe of their party that they might chooſe a Governour, that they might chooſe a Mayor, and Sheriffes, and generally the preſervation of their priviledges, to which end their Deputies made diverſe journeys to and fro, but Monſieur de Cardinal, who never omitted any thing that concerned the glory of his Maſter, and on the other ſide knew the extremities to which they were reduced ſtill told them; They muſt either all dye by famine, or ſubmit to his Majeſties diſcretion. This plain dealing of his did at laſt force them to ſtoop, whereupon they choſe twelve of the principal amongſt them, moſt of which could hardly creep to beg his Majeſties pardon, to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure him that they would live and die in the obedience which they owed unto him, without demanding any other conditions, then what his Majeſty ſhould pleaſe to give them, and one of the béſt Orators amongſt them made their ſpeech, which was all to that purpoſe. The King graunted them the pardon which they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired and the Sieur <hi>d' Herbant</hi> Secretary of State read the Pattent to them, by which his Majeſty pardoned their Rebellion, diſcharged them of all acts of Hoſtility ordained that they ſhould be reſtored to their goods, graunted them the exerciſe of their Religion in the City, and commanded that all the Souldiers in the City ſhould enjoy the ſame grace; and that the chiefe Captains and Gentlemen ſhould go out with their Swords by their ſides, and the Souldiers with Cudgells in their hands, but firſt they were to ſwear, never to bear Arms againſt his Majeſties ſervice.</p>

It is enough that they have already ſuffered great miſeries, unleſſe there be a neceſſity of continuing the War againſt others of their party, for in ſuch caſe the evils they ſuffer are examples to terrifie others, and get moderation toward them is a charm which may reduce thoſe who are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conquered to reaſon.

There were as many Citadels as Gates, and as many Caſtles, as Towers, and this was it, as made the City be eſteemed impregnable, eſpecially ſeeing it had an out-let by Sea, which could never have in broken up, but by his Majeſty extraordinary power and prudence, yet all ſerved but as Trophees, raiſed to his Majeſties glory.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Monſieur</hi> the Cardinal entred the ſame day with divers Lords and Gentlemen without any fear of infection, becauſe his preſence was very neceſſary both for his Majeſties ſervice, and to ſettle things in order, but he beſeeched his Majeſty to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear his own entrance untill All Saints day, that his Quarters might be purged from all ill ayr, and that every thing might be made ready to receive him, according to his quality and that occaſion. The day being come, his Majeſty made his entrance not with that magnificence which the ancient Emperours and Kings uſed, into ſuch Towns as they had taken, according as Hiſtory hath obſerved, but cloathed with Piety and the Mercy of a moſt Chriſtian King, Virtues however, which made him ſhine with ſo much ſplendour, that thoſe poor Rebels proſtrated themſelves as he rid by them, that they might the more acknowledge the mercy and favour he had done them: He had his Arms on, and rid in on Horſeback without any Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, onely four Companies of his Guards, two of Swiſſes, his two Troops of Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horſe arm'd <hi>Cap-a-pe,</hi> his Dragoons, and the Life-guard marched before him, all the Nobility following him, without any order to avoid the diſputes of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedency.</p>

They did not ſo much admire that his Majeſty ſhould be victorious, as
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:56802:129"/>that he ſhould Crown it with an Olive branch of ſo great mercy.

                  <p>JT is but reaſonable to give God thanks for a Victory, which is his own gift. But he much more loveth thoſe who do it in effects, not by words. There can be no greater return of thanks then to imitate his bounty which is pleaſed to do good unto us. A generous Conquerour ought not to ſpill the Bloud, and deſtroy the lives of thoſe whom he hath overcome. Amongſt the Pagans it was a uſual thing to ſucconr and aſſiſt the wounded, to relieve them with their own hands, and do good unto them: how much more reaſon have Chriſtian Princes then, to imitate ſo Chriſtian like a verrue? It is not leſſe glorious to overcome an Enemy by Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency and meekneſſe, then by Force and Prudence. Jeſus Chriſt hath promiſed a reward to ſuch as do good for evil, and he ſaith, Mercy is that which maketh men known for the Sons of his Father, who hath made the Sun to ſhine both upon the good and bad; and Kings had need make themſelves acceptable to God, whoſe Image they are, by reaſon they have a greater accompt to render him then the reſt of men.

                     </hi> inſomuch that the vertue of Clemency &amp; mercy uſed towards poor vanquiſhed Creatures, ought no longer be eſteemed a vertue, but a neceſſary means of ſalvation. I ſhould add one more reaſon out of <hi>Polybius</hi> his Hiſtory, which is, good deeds are a Chain of Gold, which do much more fix and eſtabliſh the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts of Kings then thoſe of Iron; and if Religion ſeem to invite them to practice it, neither doth reaſon of State any whit leſſe; what was it which tied the <hi>Celtiberians</hi> ſo ſtrictly and affectionately to the Roman intereſt, but that generous and noble Act of <hi>Scipio</hi> the Affrican, who reſtored a noble Lady his Priſoner to her husband, without doing her any violence or injury, and returned him all the Gold which had been brought for her ranſome? Did not <hi>Cyrus</hi> gain by his handſome treating of <hi>Creſus,</hi> after he had vanquiſhed him? Did not that tie up the hands of all <hi>Greece,</hi> who would out of the great affection they did bear to him, have highly reſented any injury done to him? The Roman Senate did much blame their Conſul, <hi>Popilius</hi> for his rude treating of the <hi>Genois,</hi> and commanded reparation to be made them, becauſe they eſteemed the honour of a Victory, not compleat, where it was atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with any cruelties or rigours. Thoſe Princes who are good to their Priſoners, and thoſe whom they have vanquiſhed, are not onely commendable, but delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to thoſe they rule over. The Romans having reduced <hi>Capadocia</hi> to a Province diminiſhed the Tax which they uſed formerly to pay unto their own King, becauſe

                     <hi>HAnnibal</hi> was diſcommended for not knowing how to purſue a Victory when obtained; and that Soveraign doth little or nothing, who after a reducing of thoſe Rebels that attempted to ſhake off the yoke of their obedience, neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to fix and ſettle them by all neceſſary orders and rules, for the continuation of them in their duties. His orders ought to be proportioned to the quality of the vanquiſhed; who if they be Rebels, ought to be treated in another manner, then ſuch as were under another Government: It ought likewiſe to be remembred, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they who are vanquiſhed be of the ſame Religion with the Conquerour; and in caſe they are not, then to eſtabliſh divers ſuch perſons there, who profeſſe the ſame with his own, and this he is obliged to by Prudence as well as Piety: It being an aſſured remedy of weakning a people if they be divided, and that a party be made ſure of amongſt them. The ancient Kings of <hi>Aegypt</hi> did wiſely tollerate and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh all ſorts of Religion in their Countries and Kingdomes to the intent the diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of opinions might diſ-unite them from any Revolts: On the other ſide, if thoſe whom a Soveraign overcommeth be his own natural Subjects, he ought not total<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to deſtroy their Cities and Towns, for that were to weaken his own power. Which is the ſame thing that <hi>Craeſus</hi> perſwaded to <hi>Cyrus,</hi> when he had been van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed by him, do not (quoth he, I beſeech you) deſtroy the Towns of <hi>Lydia,</hi> for by it you will not deſtroy me but your ſelf, to whom by right of Arms they now belong; but however this rule admitteth of exception. For if a Soveraign hath the leaſt ſuſpicion that they may revolt a ſecond time, he is then bound to deprive them of all poſſible means to effect it, be it either by diſarming the inhabitants, or diſmantling their Fortifications, nay by levelling their very Walls too, if they are of any conſiderable ſtrength. Thus did the Romans deſtroy <hi>Velitre,</hi> by reaſon of their frequent revolts, turned out the Senate, and commanded them to live on the other ſide of <hi>Tyber.</hi> The ſtrength and Fortifications of a Town do often invite the people to rebel, as <hi>Tacitus</hi> obſerveth, ſpeaking of <hi>Hieruſalem:</hi> To which ſame purpoſe did <hi>Xerxes</hi> prohibit the uſe of any Arms to the Babylonians, and <hi>Cyrus</hi> to the Lydians, both of them commanding thoſe people to ſtudy Arts which might divert them from War. It were not much amiſſe to deprive them of the means of making aſſemblies. The Romans have ſhewed the way of it, by deſtroying all form of Government amongſt thoſe of <hi>Capua,</hi> after they had overcome them, whereby they had not any occaſion of aſſembling any more together as formerly they had uſed. To this ſame end too hath the Turks inhibited the uſe of Clocks, amongſt the Chriſtians, or any others over his whole Empire, to prevent the meeting of any Aſſemblies, which might be contrary to his will, and the obedience he requireth from them. But they who are Victorious ought alwaies to accompany their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands with ſome ſweetneſſe, which may tollerate to them the exerciſe of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, the aſſurance of their goods or the like, but then at laſt he muſt be ſure to take from them all poſſible means of a future Revolt and Inſurrection.</p>

It is
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:56802:133"/>evident that if the Soveraign be Maſter of the field, then the revolted Towns can hardly be releeved or aſſiſted, becauſe of his greater power, to prevent and hinder it. Thoſe places I muſt confeſſe which are ſtrong indeed, ſeem to command and keep the Country in ſubjection, but this power of theirs can be of no long date, unleſſe their fellow Rebels have a potent Army to aſſiſt them with Convoys both of Men, Victuals, and Munition. The Tyrians were ſo inſolent by reaſon their Town was ſo ſtrongly built upon a Rock in the Sea, that they mocked at <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> when he beſieged them, and made a Bank about them to keep off any relief from comming unto them; they asked of him if he deſigned to make himſelf grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then <hi>Neptune,</hi> by that device of his to overcome the Sea, his Souldiers they called Aſſes and beaſts, becauſe they laboured without ceaſing in carrying matte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials towards the Bank; but at laſt <hi>Alexander</hi> having reduced the neighbouring Country, finiſhed his works which he had projected; and finally, forced them to render at his mercy. Which being ſo, the beſt advice that can be given to a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign for the preventing of a Revolt or the progreſs of it, is, forthwith to make himſelf maſter of the field, and to fall upon them and their Towns, without giving them leaſure to increaſe their numbers, or fortifie their Cities. For ſhewing a reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution to force them by Arms, if they ſubmit not by fair means, is a moſt power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful way to open the ſtrongeſt gates whatever. <hi>Maharbal</hi> General of <hi>Hannibals</hi> horſe, was not ignorant of this particular, when his advice was forthwith to march up to the Gates to <hi>Rome,</hi> after that famous Battel of <hi>Cannes,</hi> telling him, that there being hardly any forces at all neer or about the City, he would infallibly in a little while become Maſter of that too; <hi>Hannibal</hi> followed not his Councel, but thoſe who perſwaded him to give his Souldiers breath, but yet every one concluded he loſt a moſt fair opportunity; it having been a moſt eaſie thing in that conjuncture of time to have carried his victorious Troops to <hi>Rome,</hi> and to have forced the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens to ſet open their Gates unto him. <hi>Caeſar</hi> never did ſo, but when ever he found himſelf maſter of the field any where, preſently went on to the perfecting of his Conqueſt, which he could not think compleat, whileſt there remained any thing undone, or any ſmall place untaken.</p>

The Rendezvouz was appointed in the Bailiages of <hi>Ambrun, Gap</hi> and <hi>Briancon,</hi> where be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all come together, they who had the orders to make the muſter, and pay them, and make proviſions neceſſary for their paſſage over the Mountains, were ſo neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectfull, that they were forced to ſtay thereabouts in thoſe Bailiages about twenty dayes time, during which they committed many inſolencies and waſts, which the Marqueſſe <hi>de <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>xelles</hi> finding he was almoſt in deſpair, to ſee ſuch diſorders, all that he could do to remedy it, was, he procured the Country people to provide a certain quantity of Proviſions both for Man and War, and to carry them after the Army over the Mountains, ſome part of their money he paid them down in hand, and for the reſidue he obliged himſelf in his own name to pay them, upon the firſt Muſter. Whereupon he began to march, and on the twenty ſeventh of <hi>July,</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into the Mountains, where he no ſooner appeared, but the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> came up to them and oppoſed them where-ever they went. The reſiſtance which he here met, did not very much trouble him, for he often beat them before him; but it was his mis-fortune, that the Proviſions promiſed by thoſe of <hi>Dauphine,</hi> did not follow the Army; inſomuch that the Souldiers having marched ſome dayes without any bread, he was at laſt forced to reſolve upon returning back again; their retreat indeed was honourable enough; for the <hi>Sieur de la Ferte</hi> Marſhal <hi>de Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe</hi> facing the enemy with three Regiments upon the tops of two Mountains, gave op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to the reſt of the Troops to retire into <hi>Dauphine,</hi> which the Duke of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy</hi> could not perceive untill they were quite gone.</p>

                  <p>THE Laws of military policy require the preparing of great Magazines near the places deſigned for an enterprize, before the firſt attempt; and eſpecially not to enter upon an enemies Countrey without making ſure of a dayly proviſion for the Souldiers, that they are not brought to want. Armies are oftner ruined by hunger then by Battel; whence it happens that he who is not very carefull of carrying his Proviſions with him, or ſure of finding them where he comes, will ſoon ſee himſelf deſtitute of Troops; and in ſuch confuſion as will render him contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to his enemies, and deſpicable to his friends. This was one of the rules <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſes</hi> taught his ſon <hi>Cyrus,</hi> as <hi>Xenophon</hi> relateth it, and <hi>Cyrus</hi> was no leſſe carefull
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:56802:134"/>to practiſe it in the Wars which he made againſt the Aſſyrians, as the ſame Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor obſerveth. The Turks are very exact at it, indeed their temperance gives them one great advantage, becauſe the carriage of them is not very difficult, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them, who uſe neither Wine nor other dainties. It were to be wiſhed that ours would follow their example, becauſe the plenty in which moſt of our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders have uſed to live, renders them unable for labour, or to make any great enterprizes upon the Spaniard, by reaſon of the difficulty of carrying proviſions with them. The Romans were not ignorant of this truth, when their Empire was in its moſt flouriſhing condition; and for this reaſon it was, that they accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed their forces to great abſtinency, and thoſe Nations which were leaſt brought up in delicacies, were alwaies by them eſteemed the moſt war-like. Thus <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi> thought the Flemmings more valiant then the reſt of the Gauls, becauſe they lived upon harder fare. <hi>Hannibal</hi> to his coſt found what loſſes befell his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, after they had been accuſtomed to a lithe eaſe and plenty, when after the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel of <hi>Cannes,</hi> warring with leſſe fear of the Romans, he permitted them to live in all pleaſure and abundance, and afterwards being to make uſe of them, he found that by that means they had loſt their courages. A Captain however in avoiding this delicacy, ought not to be defective in carrying that which is neceſſary for his Souldiers. The inconveniences which will follow by ſuch neglect, are not onely as hath been ſaid, that he will ſee them disband, but withall he will find them to run to his enemies Quarters, in hope to find there better maintenance. Thus did the moſt part of <hi>Afranius</hi> and <hi>Petrius</hi> ſouldiers flie to <hi>Caeſars</hi> Camp, and thoſe of <hi>Caeſar</hi> upon the like neceſſity went unto <hi>Pompey;</hi> beſides all this, want occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth diſeaſes, as the French found at <hi>Carignan</hi> (as <hi>Guieciardin</hi> reporteth) and ſometimes cauſeth a Mutiny: In fine, it is impoſſible in ſuch occaſions but a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander muſt ſoon ſee his forces in confuſion among themſelves, and vanquiſhed by their enemies, as <hi>Vegetius</hi> hath very judicially obſerved.</p>

                  <p>ALthough his Majeſty was carefull of <hi>Monſieur de Mantua</hi> his affairs, yet did he not abandon thoſe of the Griſons his ancient Allies; but indeavoured to put them into the enjoyment of that, which had been accorded them by the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty at <hi>Mouſon:</hi> He had about the end of the laſt year ſent a Declaration to the <hi>Sieur Neſmin,</hi> his Embaſſadour with thoſe people; which imported, that according to a Clauſe of the firſt Article in that Treaty, the agreements made at <hi>Lindan</hi> and <hi>Coire,</hi> between the Arch-Duke <hi>Leopold,</hi> the Governours of <hi>Milan,</hi> and the three Cantons of the Griſons in the year 1617<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> until the day and date of the Treaty at <hi>Mouſon,</hi> ought to be null and void, and that all the Embaſſadours aſſembled in Treating with the Spaniards, were promiſed as much; yet now the Spaniards would needs give other interpretations for their own advantage to that firſt Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle, though in it ſelf nothing could be clearer, upon which great conteſts did a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe between the Griſons, the Spaniards, and the Arch-Duke <hi>Leopold.</hi> Now the Griſons deſiring his Majeſty would clear the doubt, he could not onely not refuſe them, but moreover promiſe them that they ſhould enjoy the benefit of the ſaid Treaty, and that he would aſſiſt them with his Arms, againſt any that ſhould pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to make uſe of revoked Treaties to their prejudice. They received this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration with a great deal of joy from the <hi>Sieur de Meſmin,</hi> but that was not the onely difficulty in the execution of the Treaty. The Deputies of the Griſons and the Valtolines, did preſſe his Majeſty for an expoſition of other Articles, each of them pretending to interpret it according to his own advantage, they that they ought to be eſtabliſhed in the right of Soveraignty over the Valtoline. The <hi>Comter de Chiaveunes</hi> and <hi>Bormio</hi> which they had in the year, 1617, excepting what had been nominated in the Treaty; to wit, the Juſtice and civil Government over the Valtolines; for which they were to pay them the yearly rent of twenty five thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand crowns. The other were animated by the Spaniards, that they ought abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lurely
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:56802:134" rendition="simple:additions"/>to be exempted from the Soveraignty of the Valtolines, without being ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to any other duty then the bare payment of the 25000 Crowns. Now it was likewiſe agreed in the ſaid Treaty, that in caſe any doubt ſhould ariſe upon any words the interpretation of it ſhould be referred to the two Crowns, who ſhould freely declare their ſence of it. His Majeſty had oftentimes, by his Embaſſadours, requeſted the King of <hi>Spain</hi> his Brother in Law, that they might make a Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on together for the quiet of that people; but the Spaniard who onely ſought ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage from their diviſion, delayed the Embaſſadour ſo long, that his Majeſty was at laſt forced to make a Declaration himſelf conformable to the true meaning of the intent of the Treaty, which implied, that not onely the Treaties made at <hi>Lindaw, Coire,</hi> and <hi>Milan,</hi> ſhould be void and of no effect; but withall that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formably to the ſecond Article, the affairs of the Griſons and Valtolines ſhould be reduced to the ſame ſtate they were in, in the year, 1617. by which the Griſons were reſtored to the ſame Authority and Soveraignty, which they that year had over the Valtolines, and the ſaid Comtes; and that conſequently it belonged to them alone, and not the Valtolines their Subjects to make Treaties of Peace, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liances, War, to coin monies, to grant or refuſe the Paſſages of the ſaid Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, to impoſeTaxes, Contributions and the like, and that the Valtolines could onely pretend to the Juſtice and Civil government, which for quietneſſe ſake had been granted to them under the yearly payment of twenty five thouſand crowns to the Griſons, who had the power of confirming the Magiſtrates and Poteſtates by them elected. This Declaration was ſent by the King to the <hi>Sieur Meſmin,</hi> that he might by his Prudence procure is to be accepted by both parties; to the end they might live in Peace; but with order however not to deliver it untill both par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties had agreed, to ſubmit to it according to the form and tenure of it; as alſo not to diſcover it to one or other, if he imagined both of them would make any diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty to receive it, that he might not put his royal authority into their hands. This was a remarkable effect of the Cardinals Prudence, who knew that a Kings autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity ought never to be expoſed to the contempt of his Allies; and not knowing clearly how the people were inclined, perſwaded his Majeſty to commit the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it to his Embaſſadours diſcretion: The <hi>Sieur Meſmin</hi> finding the Griſons and Valtolines not diſpoſed to accept the Declaration according to all its Clauſes, after he had under hand diſcovered the pretenſions and deſigns, which the Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards had put into their heads to hinder their good intelligence, that they might not ſhut up the Paſſges of the Valtoline againſt him, did not propoſe it in publick to have their common approbation of it; onely gave his Majeſty notice of what he had done, who approved of it, and left the deciding of thoſe differences, untill ſuch time as he ſhould carry his Arms into <hi>Italy,</hi> and have that in his hands which might maintain the juſtice f the cauſe.</p>

                  <p>PRudence teacheth a Miniſter that diſtance of place doth hinder the knowledge of the particular inclination of ſtrangers, and that thereupon it is neceſſary to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit many things to the Embaſſadours who are with them in the behalf of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter; and eſpecially concerning the form of executing ſuch Orders as are ſent him. It is a commendable diſcrecion to be perſwaded that he hath not knowledge and power enough to do all things of himſelf; whereas, they who ſuffer themſelves to be led by a vain preſumption, upon their own parts, do uſually commit their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters authority to the inconſiderateneſſe and inconſtancy of neighbours, expoſe them to ſcorn by the little reſpect they give his Orders, and in fine leave them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out effect. For this very reaſon a diſcreet Politician laughed at the Florentines and Venetians, who in his time would needs give themſelves all particular Orders in their Army, even to the appointing of the places for their Batteries. We ſee in Hiſtory that the Romans did commit the execution of their Commiſſions to the Prudence of thoſe whom they imployed, were it in Peace or War. <hi>Caeſar</hi> upon
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:56802:135"/>his reſolution for an expedition into <hi>England,</hi> gave the command of three Legions and two thouſand horſe to <hi>Labienus,</hi> to look after <hi>France</hi> in his abſence; but he gave him no particular Orders, onely to act as the neceſſity of affairs did require. <hi>Tiberius</hi> one of the wiſeſt of the Roman Emperours did the like (as <hi>Tacitus</hi> reports) when he ſent his ſon <hi>Druſus</hi> into <hi>Hungary,</hi> for the reducing of ſome revolted Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions unto obedience, giving him no other order for his Conduct, but that which himſelf ſhould think proper to be done, when he was upon the place. He muſt needs be ignorant of the Roman cuſtome, who knows not that it was their uſe to inſert in their Commiſſions whom they imployed, a particular command that they did not intereſt in any thing which they did in the publick concerns of the State; and if any one ſhould ſuffer him to be carried by his own will to do otherwiſe, they were never wanting for the moſt part; but to confeſſe that it was not poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for them being at a diſtance, to know all that is proper to be done As when the Conſul <hi>Fabius</hi> had beaten the Tuſcans near <hi>Sutres,</hi> and had reſolved to purſue them through the Forreſt <hi>Simine</hi> to invade <hi>Tuſcany;</hi> the Senate miſ-informed of what he might do, ſent two Senators to him to diſſwade him from the attempt; but before the Senators had come to him, they found he had already paſſed the Forreſt, and obtained the Victory which he ſought for, at which they were much aſtoniſhed. This ſerves at leaſt to ſhew that a great liberty ought to be left to thoſe who are imployed, eſpecially when by reaſon of diſtance there cannot be a particular information of all Occurrences; and that he who doth otherwiſe, loſeth many advantages in War, and alſo in negotiations of Peace; and inſtead of getting glory, renders himſelf contemptible both in one and in the other.</p>

Opportunity is oftentimes of greater advantage then ſeveral Troops; and Experience hath dayly evidenced to the World, that the advantages of time is the onely thing, which if laid hold on, carrieth great actions to a proſperous iſſue. Nature obſerveth her time to put forth her works, we ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſee her bedight with Flowers, but when the Sun ſmiles gently upon her; juſt thus is it with a Prudent man, he muſt ſtrike when the Iron is hot, and not ſtrike untill it be hot. For this reaſon it was, that the Pythagoreans held opportunity to be the firſt cauſe of all things; and it is but truth, that opportunity is that which giveth them all their perfections, and cauſeth them to terminate in a happy ſucceſſe. Antiquity did much eſteem of <hi>Pittacus</hi> his advice, which was comprehended in two words onely, know thy time, that is, loſe not thy opportunity, but make ſure of it, it being certainly true, that the leaſt ſmile which ſhe beſtoweth is the ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work of great ſucceſſes, above all, an enemy ought to be aſſaulted at his weakeſt, before he be fortified, and that his other Troops come to joyn with him.

For, firſt the Government of the State could not have been left with any other, but it would have raiſed great broils in the State; and ſecondly, he had much rather have been thought impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident in fore-ſeeing that might hurt him, then ingratefull in not procuring to her all poſſible honour, lying in his power; and laſtly, he had ſome reaſon to hope, that the abſolute power which his Majeſty left with her during his abſence, might open her eyes, to diſcern with what zeal and fidelity he had ſerved her. In fine, his Majeſty give the Queen his Mother, full, and abſolute power, and cauſed the Commiſſion which he had made for that purpoſe, to bee read in the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.</p>

                  <p>AMongſt the many and ſundry powers which are in the Perſons of our Kings, as ſo many Glorious Rayes which encompaſſe their Majeſty, Juſtice is one, and one of the greateſt Suſter; The Scepter which they carry in their hand, is an Index of it, and ſeems to ſay, that their will is the Rule by which their ſubjects muſt be govern'd: whence a Lawyer defining Law, confoundeth it with the will of the Prince declared to his ſubjects. It is true, they hold Juſtice in their left hands, that they may remember their Commands ought alwayes to be accompanied with Equity. But beſides all this, they are not bound to give an accompt to any one. It is onely God from whom they receive t heir Scepter, and it is to him only that they are to be accomptable for the Reaſon of thoſe Laws which they eſtabliſh: Their power is high and ſo abſolute, that there is no refuſing of what they ordaine; and indeed their Laws are of force and power, not ſo much becauſe they are Juſt, as becauſe they are by them commanded. However Prudence obligeth them to be adviſed by their Parliaments, whenſoever they would make any Laws or Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances. This was the ancient form as Hiſtory obſerveth, when any General Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances were to be eſtabliſhed: and this is it which maketh the people receive them with the more ſubmiſſion and willingneſs; for nothing is ſo acceptable to them as that which carrieth the leaſt ſhew of abſolute Soveraignty; and beſides Kings do no leſſe Rule their people by Prudence then Power. Now this Prudence requireth, that nothing ought to be acted but by the deliberation of thoſe who are to give a Credit to it, for the obſervation and obedience which is expected to be payd unto it. All our Kings have allowed their Parliaments to make Remonſtrances, and give their opinions, as occaſion ſhould require: Indeed they have alwayes done it with great ſubmiſſion and reſpect, as being a thing without the limits of their power. <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

It is not poſſible long to deny him, his diſcourſes are repleniſhed with ſuch an, I know not what ſweetneſſe, which inſinuateth it ſelf into the heart, his geſture and complaſance do no leſſe ſecond his diſcourſe, and they ought to be eſteemed for ſuch, as the beſt wits have confeſſed, it was impoſſible to defend themſelves from him, whatever promiſes they had made of ſticking cloſe to any reſolutions of theirs contrary to his deſires.</p>

Raſh Eloquence would do him no good, it being like counterfeit Gold, gliſters indeed, but is worth nothing; and a mute prudence, where there is a defect of good expreſſion, is of no great uſe, but is like a fair ſtatue whoſe proportions and ſculpture are admired by every one, but cannot ſpeak, whereas Eloquence and Prudence joyned together work miracles.

It cannot be denied but that Eloquence was one of thoſe qualities which did inſinuate into the peoples belief that Doctrine, which Jeſus Chriſt preached, ſeeing the Goſpel it ſelf recorded it, where it is ſaid, that the ſweetneſſe of thoſe words which came from his mouth, raviſhed the people with admiration. And who can doubt of the power which Rhetorick hath on mens minds, ſeeing that tongues were the firſt Arms given the Apoſtles, when they were ſent abroad to preach? Indeed there cannot be an handſomer ornament added to the dignity of great Miniſters, then to diſcourſe well, nor really ſtronger Arms to their Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. Their affairs will continually lead them to treat with Grandees, who muſt be ſatisfied with reaſons, which when well expreſſed, are the more perſwaſive. They muſt know how to appeaſe, to mollifie, or provoke paſſions by the addreſſe of their diſcourſe according as occaſion requires. Is it moſt certain that naked reaſon is

                  <p>IT is no leſſe advantagious than ſeemly for a Prince to give Orders in his Battels, and to appear in his own perſon to ſee them executed as well by his example as command. I ſay it is ſeemly, in regard Kings have not received their ſwords from the hand of God, onely to devolve the charge and conduct of their Armies upon their Captains; Their crowns are not beſtowed on them ſo much for the honour of their own perſons, as to oblige them to maintain and encreaſe by the prudence of their counſels, and the force of their Arms, the glory of their States: they are like the Sun, who doth not onely communicate part of its light and influence to the Stars, to the end they might contribute to the generation and conſervation of all things here below; but doth likewiſe himſelf daily go round the world to co-operate with all particular cauſes, and doth in ſome ſence do all in every thing; thus like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe a great Prince ought to watch whatever happens of importance in his Army; to paſſe from Quarter to Quarter, and to iſſue out all principal Orders from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, without relying on his Officers, but in things of leſſe conſequence; remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring the excellent Counſel which <hi>Saluſt</hi> gave <hi>Caeſar,</hi> when he told him that they, who are advanced to an high degree of honour in a State, are obliged to be much more vigilant and careful than others. Who can expreſſe the advantage which happens to a King by being himſelf the Oracle of his Counſels, who obligeth his Soldiers to obſerve his Orders, as well by his example as command. The example
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:56802:140"/>of a King needs not indeed any words of command, for it inſinuateth it ſelf into their courages, and animateth them with ſuch reſolution, that it leads them to all enterpriſes how dangerous ſoever; his courage is the fire which heats all his Soldiers, and the leaſt action which he ſhall do among them, will more powerfully perſwade them to fight, then any words he can give them, be they never ſo many or fair. Was it not for this reaſon that <hi>Germanicus,</hi> as <hi>Tacitus</hi> relateth, uſed to open his Helmet in his Battels, that he might make himſelf known to his Soldiers; that the Kings of <hi>Perſia</hi> went bare-headed, and that <hi>Cyrus,</hi> as <hi>Xenophon</hi> witneſſeth, would often call his Captains and Soldiers by their names, and give them ſuch Orders, as himſelf ſaw fit? and doth he not give a good reaſon for it, where he ſaith, that if a Phyſitian were to be blamed for not knowing the names of his medicines, and the artificer for being ignorant of the uſe of his inſtruments; a Prince deſerves much more to be diſcommended, if he knoweth not the names of his Officers and Soldiers, the inſtruments of the glory which he acquireth in Armes?</p>

But his Majeſty knowing what mettle his preſence infuſed into his Soldiers, and ſeeing there was not a man amongſt them, who thought not himſelf happy in being expoſed to all ſorts of hazards, he reſolved that all thoſe hardſhips ſhould not divert him from acquiring freſh victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries: However knowing that it is Gods providence, which doth contribute more then mans force to happy ſucceſſes, he would hear Maſſe before he engaged with the Enemy, to recommend his enterpriſe to God; then he came into the field with the Cardinal between 6 and 7 in the morning, and gave order what troops ſhould make the onſet. The Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> had formed 3 Baracados before the paſſages, the firſt a Quarter of a league from <hi>Chaumont</hi> near upon the borders between France and <hi>Savoy,</hi> the 2 about a quarter of a league farther of, and the 3 under the Fort <hi>de Gelaſſe,</hi> ſcituated upon a rock, at the foot of which they muſt of neceſſity paſſe at the mercy of the Cannons and musket. All 3 were 12 foot thick and large, 20 high, the Ditch deep, and 8 foot over to defend the Avenues; He had likewiſe made between 25 and 30 Redoubts guarded by 2700 choiſe men. Upon the firſt diſcovery of their ſcituation, the victory was thought difficult, but as there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing impoſſible to the King and the Cardinal, they lead up their forces at the firſt peep of day.

It is no ſhame for neceſſity to take the Law of one that is more powerful, but if power prevail, the who is forced to it, is diſcredited with intereſt: beſides, in paſſages, how ſtrait or difficult ſoever they be, he cannot be able to defend himſelf from the danger which is falling on him, unleſs he be very ſtrong ſeeing that enemy, who comes to aſſault him with a great Army, will at laſt force him, although they looſe ſome men in the gaining it: Commonly there is not above one or two diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult places in a paſſage, and it is impoſſible, but that a great Army of reſolute men ſhould gain them. In fine when they who defend them ſhall find an whole Army thundring in upon them, it ſtrikes a terror into them ſo that they are forced to fly, and by that means deſtroyed, for this reaſon the Romans would never put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the trouble of keeping any paſſes, unleſs they ſaw it neceſſary to expect the Enemy, becauſe they who were in the chief Stands, ſhould be alwayes aſſiſted: but it is not the ſame thing when a Garriſon hath nothing to ſecond it, or where there are no reſerves to aſſiſt thoſe whom an Enemy ſhall firſt have routed.</p>

<pb n="275" facs="tcp:56802:142"/>ſome who were admiring that his enterprizes ſhould have ſuch ill ſucceſſe; ſeeing in his diſcourſe he ſeemed to be a very prudent and diſcreet man. That he was one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Maſter of his Language, but that Fortune was Maſter in Military Affairs. And do we not for this reaſon likewiſe, ſay, that the diſcreet man is not obliged to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der an accompt of thoſe enterpriſes which depend as much on Chance, as Conduct, but onely of his Councels, which is the onely thing that was in his power to diſpoſe? It is ſometimes onely Fortune which raiſeth a ſiege without a ſtroke; it is Fortune which doth ſometimes ſtrike a terrour into an enemies Forces, that they have hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the courage to defend themſelves; Fortune it is which hath often opened the ſtrongeſt places at the firſt Summons; and it is Fortune, which at the appearance of an Army, hath cauſed many Provinces to ſtoop under their Power and Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. But notwithſtanding all this, we muſt not conceive Fortune to be, as the Heathens did, a blind Goddeſſe, who over ruleth Battels, and giveth the Victory to what ſide ſhe pleaſeth; no, it is of the divine Providence, that I ſpeak, which is uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſo called, when any thing befalleth us above our expectation, or beyond our hopes. God is the firſt cauſe of all good ſucceſſe, and it is his onely gift, he it is who bleſſeth Councels, and it is by the favour of his influences, that we ſee good fruits or follow ſage reſolutions. Neither may we imagine, that the Prudence of great men doth not contribute to an happy ſucceſſe; for they are the inſtruments of Gods power, but not ſuch as are dead and void of life, or ſuch as want motion and action to co-operate with the firſt cauſe. As it may be ſaid that <hi>Alexander</hi> was fortunate in all his enterprizes: But this fortune was improved by Prudene, conſerved by cares, preſerved by Labours, and ſeconded by Courages.

                  <p>IT is no leſſe Policy in a Prince to make himſelf feared by ſtrangers, then beloved by his own Subjects. To pretend that he is in friendſhip with them were a vanity, for they having no end but intereſt care not for any one longer then he is uſefull. The greateſt peece of their friendſhip, is, not to offend their neighbours, or attempt upon their Territories, and there are but a few who are thus reſerved; whence it happens that he who ſheweth them his Power, and ſometimes lets them feel his

                  <p>AS all Womankind hath by birth received certain qualities contrary to the good conduct of a Kingdome; ſo it is very dangerous for them who govern, to lend an ear to their charms. I cannot more fitly compare them to any thing, then to the Sun in the Spring-time, who hath then power to raiſe and attract vapors into the ayr, but not to allay or diſſipate them: Juſt thus it is with them, many are the broyls which they raiſe and foment in a State; but the remedying of any one of them lieth not in their power. It ſhould ſeem that whatever is proper to trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the repoſe of a State, is naturally imprinted in them; every one knoweth what diſorders violence breedeth, and who can be ignorant that the heats and emotions of their Paſſions, are like impetuous torrents, which pull up Rocks, root up Trees, overthrow whatever ſtandeth in their way? they do nothing by halfs, all their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires are accompanied with fire, and although few of their reſolutions are grounded upon any conſideration or foreſight yet there is not any obſtacle which they will not force themſelves to overcome, in the executing of their Wills and Inclinations. Imprudence too carrieth no leſſe broyls where it goeth; this is natural to them, and dayly experience ſheweth us, that they have in all their actions more raſhneſſe then diſcretion. <hi>Pallas</hi> her ſelf, the Goddeſſe of Prudence, was born of <hi>J<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

The ſpirit of revenge where it is Lord Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount, is enough to ſet a State on fire; for whileſt they who are poſſeſſed with it, indeavour to execute their wills upon perſons in power, upon the leaſt reſiſtance they ſhe out into extremities, and by force attempt to repel force; but who are more prone to revenge then women? their natural fearfulneſſe doth the more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily ingage them, becauſe they attribute the moſt part of their faults, unto ſome neglect or diſ-eſteem. They have not wit enough to diſſemble thoſe many defects which are in them, though it were moſt for their advantage, eſpecially in ſuch miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriages as happen more by their weakneſſe then malice. Their Soul is offended at the leaſt touch, whereas great perſonages ought to know, that it is more glorious to pardon then to puniſh; Briefly, the irreſolution which they diſcover in all their actions, and which they cannot for their lives hide, is the cauſe of a thouſand diſorders, eſpecially when any one ingageth to follow their advices and directions; now they counſel one thing, and by and by another, then they know not what to reſolve, and the leaſt difficulty they meet with, maketh them change a thouſand times over.

                  <p>HIS Majeſty having ſtayed at <hi>Suze</hi> as long as was needfull for the ſecuring of thoſe advantages which he had got; as alſo for the conveying of Wheat and all other neceſſaries into <hi>Cazal</hi> and the places of <hi>Montferrat</hi> in caſe they ſhould be again ſet upon after his with drawing back, he at laſt reſolved to paſſe through <hi>Languedoc.</hi> His deſign was onely to bring the revolted Heretiques under obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, who had of late ſhewed their teeth againſt him, upon all occaſions and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities whatever. Notwithſtanding his Majeſties Declaration made at <hi>Paris,</hi> as hath heretofore been obſerved, they had made an Aſſembly at <hi>Niſms,</hi> where they publiſhed a ſedition manifeſt, by which they indeavoured to repreſent his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties gracious proffers, for ſo many ſnares to intrap them; and that notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his Kingly word, he intended to put them all to the Sword; whereupon it was reſolved not to lay down their Arms, but by and with the conſent of the King of <hi>England;</hi> to which effect, all they of the Town and Party, were to bind themſelves by oath, which was as much as to ſay, they peremptorily reſolved to continue the War as long as ever they could. The King of <hi>England</hi> being troubled for the affront which had been given his forces both at <hi>Ree,</hi> and before <hi>Rochel,</hi> deſired no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more then to ſee <hi>France</hi> divided, and at War amongſt themſelves, which would be a great dimunition of his Majeſties ſtrength and power. <hi>Monſieur de Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>han</hi> had likewiſe been with the King of <hi>England</hi> in the behalf of the Aſſembly, to implore his Protection, and to let him know that they of his party having built all their hopes upon the expectation of his ſuccours, did humbly beſeech him not to defer any longer his aſſiſting of them. Were not theſe ſo many evident ſigns and tokens of an intended bloudy War, for the ſecuring of themſelves in thoſe Towns which were ſtrong, and in their own powers? did they not hope his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty would find work enough to be diverted in <hi>Italy,</hi> and that he might neither have time nor power to fall on them, or oppoſe their deſigns? And after all this what reaſon was there to give any longer way to this rebellious people, to fix and root themſelves any more in their obſtinacies and willfull perverſeneſſe? Muſt not his Majeſty in ſo doing have been defective both in Prudence and Courage? But the Cardinal was too induſtrious to ſuffer any ſuch blemiſhes to lie upon his Maſters glory; ſo that he perſwaded his Majeſty, that it was now high time, to call them to accompt, and that he ſhould forthwith ſet forward to curb in their inſolencies, and to ſet bounds to their unlimited Pride and Rebellion.</p>

In ſuch occaſions, he ought to uſe an extraordinary diligence; for if vigilance and care be neceſſary in ſuch enterpriſes as are made abroad, much more is it in thoſe nearer home; eſpecially when it concerneth the keeping of a people (inclined to Rebel) within the limits of their duty.

                  <p>JT is not lawfull for one Prince to ſupport the Rebellions which another Princes Subjects raiſe againſt him, ſeeing he is no leſſe bound to deal juſtly with his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, then with his own Subjects. If Equity doth not bound in his Ambition, God who is the Judge of all Kings, dealeth juſtly with him, if he be whipt with the ſame Rod; and as there is not any Crime in a Subject, ſo bad as that of Rebellion; ſo neither can one Prince do a greater out-rage to another, then by protecting it; ſeeing it is that which woundeth the very heart of a State, and diſordereth the moſt powerfull Spring by which Soveraigns govern their people. Juſtice is without doubt the ſtrongeſt Pillar of Kingly Government; that which makes them long to Reign; that which ſecureth them from forraign enterpriſes, and the ſtrongeſt Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wark to defend them, as the wiſeſt of Kings hath ſaid in his Proverbs; and it may be truely ſaid, that, that is it, which renders their Government exempted from the Dominion both of Time and Fortune.

That which is unjuſtly got, will not long laſt unleſſe preſerved by Juſtice: Kingdomes are ſaid to be like Tortoiſes, which as long as they keep within their own Precincts are ſafe and ſecure; but in danger when once they are abroad. And I do verily believe, that, that which hath made the French Monarchy of ſo long a continuance, is, becauſe it never yet carried its Forces without its own bounds, unleſſe for the juſt defence of its Allies, or at leaſt to preſerve that which belongeth unto it. It hath imitated the River <hi>Nile,</hi> never over-flowed its own Banks; but it inriched thoſe places where it paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.

But I pray was not this to hint to her, that ſhe had leſſe power with his Majeſty then the Cardinal, the ready way to touch her to the quick? and to the quick ſhe was touched, for ſhe laid all the Blame of the Kings denial upon his ſcore, ſhe began to be offended and in an ill humour againſt him, teſtifying to him, that it was her abſolute deſire he ſhould be made Marſhal of <hi>France,</hi> and forcing him to obtain that honour for him from his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty; The Cardinal uſed preſently his utmoſt power with his Majeſty to perſwade and incline him to it; he repreſented to him, that there is a neceſſity ſometimes to beſtow Honours and Offices upon them, who deſerve them not, but upon divers other conſiderations; and that the Queen Mothers ſatisfaction was one chief rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, inſomuch that his Majeſty did at laſt beſtow a Marſhals ſtaffe upon him; The Cardinal, who could not be ignorant of all their Contrivances, aſſured him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, that theſe Inſtances of the Queen Mother, proceeded from the Suggeſtions of ſome Cabal or other, &amp; not from her own Natural diſpoſition: But however his <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> did acquaint him with the Remedy, as ſoon as the deſeaſe, he intended rather to hazard his own Intereſts, (though it were with ſome repugnance) and to take his own advantages againſt this new Officer of the Crown, then to deny the Queen Mother, governing himſelf in this particular by the Laws of Prudence, which ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige a man, to wink at ſome diſorders, for want of means potent enough to redreſſe them.</p>

The Honour which is done to an Ambitious perſon, ſerves him only to be the more active and ſtirring; and as he believeth all things to be his due, ſo he thinketh not himſelf obliged for any thing procured to him: and beſides all this, The paſſion which he hath, ſtill to be ſoaring a loft being greater then the Remembrance of him, who procured him his Honour, will engage him in deſigns againſt that very perſon, who hath obliged him, if he doeth but once apprehend it to be for his private intereſt.

                  <p>This happy ſucceſſe, was of great advantage unto the Kings Forces, and did ſo perplex the Duke of <hi>Rohan,</hi> that he could not tell how to ſteer his courſe. Some who were well affected unto his Majeſties Intereſts, gave notice of the trouble in what <hi>Monſieur de Rohan</hi> then was, and the Cardinal, who is ſure never to looſe any the leaſt occaſion of ſerving his Majeſty, found means ſo to work on him, that he got him to ſubmit unto his Majeſties mercy; he repreſented to him, how raſh he was in ſupporting this revolt; That nothing but mis-fortune could arrive to him in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular by it, for that his Majeſty was fully reſolved to cut the wings of hereſie and Rebellion; That he ought in reaſon to be ſatisfied, with the excerciſe of his Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, as alſo thoſe of his party, and that returning to his duty, he might in time hope to receive thoſe honours which were due to his Birth. The Duke hereupon went privately unto his Majeſty, promiſed in future to continue Loyal, and proteſted to live in an exact obedience. The King freely pardoned him, on condition, that he

Now he being the head of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, his repentance could not be ſo cloſely carried, but that many began to perceive it, and follow his ſteps. Divers Deputies of the principal Hugonot Towns came in and did the like. The reſt being allarumed by the happy ſucceſſe of his Majeſties forces, &amp; fearing to become Subjects of their fury and rage, diſpoſed themſelves to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of peace, and made divers Propoſals for a general accommodation, which were brought unto the Cardinal, but thought unworthy for the King to grant.

This Calumniator ſearching for pretences, whereby he might incenſe the Queen Mother againſt him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and inſtigate her to complain unto his Majeſty, and whereby ſhe might be provoked to do her utmoſt for his deſtruction; amongſt other forgeries, writeth, That ſhe could no longer indure to ſee him expoſe his Majeſties perſon unto ſo eminent dangers, as paſſing over the Alps in the dead of the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and commanding of an Army infected with the Plague, and thorough a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try full of ſickneſſe, in the very heat of all the Summer. But how ſenceleſly hath he alledged it, how without truth or judgement? Surely nothing but paſſion and heat, the two enemies of reaſon and truth, could thus guide his Pen, whoſe onely quarrel is the meanneſſe and diſorder of his Fortune, which he thinks muſt all be attributed to the Cardinal, without conſidering that it is the effect of his own miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demeanours and ill behaviour. Is there any man living ſo ſenceleſſe, beſides him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, as to beleeve, that the Cardinal ſhould hazard his Majeſties life and perſon, when as all his Fortune and hopes depend onely upon him? Was he not at that time well acquainted, how mortally the Queen Mother hated him? that <hi>Monſieur</hi> had no affection for him? and that by conſequence, if his Majeſty ſhould miſcarry his diſgrace and ruine were unavoidable? The Queen Mother could not poſſibly be of his opinion, ſeeing her complaint was, that the Cardinal was too much tied to his Majeſties Intereſts; which one conſideration alone, were enough to have kept him off from hazarding his Majeſties health upon a ſlight occaſion, if his Loyalty had been capable of ſo great an Infidelity: But what would not the detain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his Majeſty have been, to raviſh from him one of the greateſt Subjects of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry that had been preſented to him ſince his Reign? had he ſtayed at <hi>Paris,</hi> he had been hindred from his journey to <hi>Suze,</hi> from the raiſing the ſiege at <hi>Cazal,</hi> he had never forced the Alps in deſpight of the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> though ſeconded with the forces of <hi>Spain;</hi> he had not returned by <hi>Languedoc,</hi> and there brought all the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious Hugonots under his obedience, who had had the boldneſſe to take up Arms againſt him. The Kings Generoſity was ſuch, that ſhould the Cardinal have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded him from the expedition withall his Art, yet I am confident he would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have been perſwaded to let any one elſe go and gather the Harveſt of that glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious expedition. Beſides the Cardinal had much forgot himſelf, ſhould he have
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:56802:150"/>attempted to divert the King from this deſign, ſeeing there could not be any appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent hazard of his health; doth not every one know, that his Majeſty was uſed from his Infancy, to endure the ayr, and that he could not ſuffer much more in this Journey then he commonly did in his huntings? I ſhall only add this one conſideration more. Hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </head>
                  <p>THE Cardinal having at laſt perſwaded his Majeſty, to commit the Army to his Government for the reducing of <hi>Montauban,</hi> he thought good to ſend the <hi>Sieur de Guron,</hi> ſome few dayes before he advanced, unto the Inhabitants of the Town, to let them know his Majeſties pleaſure, and to incline them to peace, by all fair wayes; He had expreſs order to aſſure them, in his Majeſties behalf, of the free excerciſe or their Religion, the enjoyment of all their goods and Eſtates, and a full pardon for what was paſſed; but on the other ſide, to refuſe them all other their demands, of Fortifications and the like which they did uſually heretofore require for their ſecurity, (and as a pledge of performance) becauſe ſubjects ought not to pretend, to any other Gages from their Soveraign, then his Princely word. The <hi>Sieur de Guron</hi> began his Journey towards them, with a Convoy of certain light
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:56802:150"/>Horſe; and being arrived at <hi>Villemur,</hi> where the <hi>Comte d'Arpajon</hi> then Quartered, the Count forthwith diſpatched a Trumpetter to the Chief Conſul of <hi>Montauban,</hi> to give him notice, That the <hi>Sieur de Guron</hi> was come thither, ſent by his Majeſty to declare his will unto them, and alſo adviſed him, that he thought it convenient, that they diſcourſed with him before he were admitted into the Town; to which effect, if he would the next morning come to <hi>Corbariou,</hi> the ſaid <hi>Sieur de Guron</hi> would meet him in the <hi>Meadow</hi> juſt over againſt the River Tar; which was prudently done of them, to avoid any diſ-eſteem or neglect which might be put upon the Kings Authority, there being little or no aſſurance to be given to revolted people, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to them, ſeeing they had retained a Trumpetter, ſent to them on a Meſſage not long before by <hi>Monſieur</hi> the Prince, at which time they likewiſe proteſted, that they would keep all that were ſent to them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> peradventure for repriſal of ſome, whom the Duke <hi>a'Eſpernon</hi> had kept of theirs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The Chief Conſul of <hi>Montauban,</hi> with about two hundred more of the ableſt Towns-men, came out the next morning to <hi>Corbariou,</hi> but making ſome ſcruple of paſſing the Tar, to go unto the <hi>Sieur de Guron,</hi> who then was in the Cloſe before mentioned, they ſent two Deputies to him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to entreat him he would come to <hi>Corbariou.</hi> This procedure of theirs was againſt the reſpect which they owed unto his Majeſty, by their thus treating of him whom he had ſent unto them. Neither would he ſuffer it, but ſent them word, That their hearts were yet too full of Pride, inſtead of a ſenſe which they ought to have of their faults, that he would neither ſee nor ſpeak with them, but would return, in hopes however, of comming again a little better accompanied then he was; ſo accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly he cauſed his Trumpet to ſound, and away he went the direct way to <hi>Ville<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur,</hi> but the Diſcreeteſt amongſt the Deputies, conſidering that this offence would reflect on his Majeſties Perſon, who might hereafter puniſh them for it, preſently ſent after him, to aſſure him that they would the next day ſend their Deputies to him, to crave his pardon for their fault, and to beſeech him, he would do them the honor to come ſee them at <hi>Montauban:</hi> accordingly the next morn, ſix Deputies came to <hi>Villemur</hi> to him, entreated him to excuſe their fault, and beſeeched him with a great deal of ſubmiſſion, that their errour might not hinder them from his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties grace and favour, which they hoped to receive by his Mediation. The <hi>Sieur de Guron,</hi> finding how deſirous they were to ſee and treat with him, (a ſigne, that many had a good inclination to ſubmiſſion) accepted of their excuſes, and reſolved to go with them the very ſame day; He went with them, and they of the Town be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now a little more humbled, ſent out all the Nobility and Gentry which were then there, about half a league, to meet him, who accompanied him to the lodging prepared for him, and the whole Corporation of the Town came to ſalute him.</p>

                  <p>IT is an Act of Imprudence to incenſe the minds of a Rebellious people<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying them their Liberty and enjoyment of their goods. Thoſe two things, ought to be granted them at firſt word; but then, diſcretion commandeth a Prince to hold them cloſe to it, and to refuſe them any other demands, which the fickle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the multitude will propoſe unto him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Experience hath often made it evident, that the vulgar being rude and rough, are only to be bent by ſeverity, now when once they are warm'd in a Rebellion, what but that will work any thing at all on them? A fiery Horſe is only to be tam'd by the whip and ſpur, and it is a vanity to hope for the reducing of a people by careſſes and kindneſſes: Admit you grant them whatever they demand, yet it is well known they are of ſo inſatiable a nature, of ſo greedy an humour, that the more is given them, the more they deſire: If they find their firſt deſires granted with eaſe, inſtead of being contented, they aſſume the liberty to demand more, like <hi>Hydropiques,</hi> whom drinking makes more thirſty. <hi>Lewis</hi> the twelveth, found it thus by experience, preſently after he had taken <hi>Milan,</hi> as <hi>Guicciardine</hi> hath obſerved: Beſides his natural Bounty, which inclined him to favour the people in almoſt every thing, he thought himſelf a little more obliged to grant them of <hi>Milan</hi> ſome extraordinary favours, that he might render them
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:56802:151"/>more affectionate to himſelf, and that he might by this means aſſure and confirm his new Conqueſts: Inſomuch that he eaſily granted them all the favours they could reaſonably have deſired. But his deſign ſucceeded very ill; for the <hi>Milanois</hi> in ſtead of being ſatisfied with their firſt gratifications, took the boldneſs to deſire the being exempted from certain Impoſitions, which lay a little too heavy on them; which the King, though with ſome difficulty, did at laſt grant unto them; but the obtaining of this made them ſo inſatiable, that their next requeſt was, to be freed from all taxes whatever, nay ſo unjuſt and unreaſonable they were that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came more incenſed againſt him, for his laſt refuſal, then if he had never obliged them; which they had never done, had he not been too free with them at firſt; his ſafeſt way having been, to have taken time to deliberate, and conſider on their firſt propoſals, and have given hopes of obtaining ſome part of them, which would have made them more modeſt in all their ſucceeding Requeſts.</p>

                  <head>Proſecution of the Subject.</head>
                  <p>THE <hi>Sieur de Guron,</hi> having received the Complements and viſits of all the Towns-men, by their ſeveral Companies, he addreſſed himſelf to treat with the Conſuls concerning his buſineſs; It was agreed between them, that he ſhould the next morning come to the Town Houſe, and ſhew his Majeſties letter of Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, as alſo that of <hi>Monſieur</hi> the Cardinal, and acquaint the Aſſembly with the ſubject of his Commiſſion. The Cardinal, by a provident foreſight, had ſent two of the Deputies of <hi>Niſmes,</hi> with the <hi>Sieur de Guron,</hi> Gentlemen of great eſteem in the Hugonot party, affable and wel ſpoken, who might teſtifie to thoſe ſtubborn peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Montauban,</hi> with how great Clemency and Mercy his Majeſty, had pardoned them; and on the other ſide, how ſeverely he had chaſtiſed thoſe of <hi>Privas</hi> for their Rebellion; how that they for their parts lived in a great deal of quiet &amp; freedome in the Exerciſe of their Religion; how punctual <hi>Monſieur</hi> the Cardinal was to perform whatever he promiſed to them, and all others; how it was in vain to hold out in hopes of ſuccour or aſſiſtance, ſeeing thoſe very perſons who had ingaged them in the War, had already made their Peace. Theſe Deputies upon their firſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, began to execute the deſign for which they came, to wit, to diſpoſe the Chief of the City to ſubmit, as they had done. The next morning the <hi>Sieur de Guron</hi> came to the Town houſe, where he diſcourſed to them with ſuch Eloquence, Ingenuity and Addreſs, that he made a good Impreſſion on them; He related to them the many victories and good ſucceſs, which had alwayes accompanied his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties Arms; the mis-fortunes of <hi>Rochel</hi> and <hi>Privas,</hi> which they too could not poſſibly avoid, if they perſiſted in their Rebellion; he likewiſe told, that his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty was fully reſolved not to ſuffer any people or places in his Kingdome, which were not in his power and under his obedience; Next of all, he acquainted them, that his Majeſty did paſſe his word to them, for enjoyment of their goods, and the exerciſe of their Religion, whilſt they for their parts continued in their duties and obedience, and laſtly he gave them to underſtand how inviolable an obſerver the Cardinal was of his word and he conjured them to be abſolutely confident of whatever the Cardinal ſhould promiſe to them: They were generally ſo touched with this diſcourſe, that they preſently ſeemed to be as much inclined to Peace, as formerly they had been to War. The Deputies of <hi>Niſmes</hi> ſeconded the <hi>Sieur de Guron's</hi> ſpeech, and were not wanting to acquaint the people unto what mis-for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes ſome other Towns of their party had been reduced; The Peace and quietneſs, which they enjoyed by the Kings bounty, the deceits of them, who had engaged them in this War by their great hopes of ſuccors, which were now vaniſhed, ſeeing their head had made his Peace with his Majeſty; That the great victories, which his Majeſty had of late obtained, might ſufficiently let them ſee that nothing was able to reſiſt him, and that this had been the chief reaſon which had induced them, and thoſe of their City, to caſt themſelves at his Majeſties feet, and that after, had had the honour to confer with the Cardinal, they admired the incomparable vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:56802:151"/>which were ſo eminently apparent in him, experimented his meekneſſe, and been ſenſible of the truth of his promiſes, they could no longer defer their reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but had great hopes of receiving as many favours by his bounty, as they had heretofore ſuffered miſchiefs by the ambition of thoſe whom they had choſen for their heads. It cannot be expreſſed how great an impreſſion theſe reaſons made upon the people. However their Rebellion having taken a deep root in them, they could not reſolve till after two dayes to ſend their Deputies to the Cardinal, neither would they give any other anſwer to the <hi>Sieur de Guron,</hi> onely beſeeched him that their Deputies might have the honour to wait upon him. Thus was their final ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion reſerved by Heaven for the Cardinals Prudence, who alone was able to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce ſo admirable an effect.</p>

                  <p>THE fear of thoſe miſeries which uſually accompany revolts, is of greater efficacy to reduce a people to their duty, then any other reaſons whatever. As nature hath given them a rude and unpoliſhed ſpirit, ſo the reſpect and obligations which they owe their Princes, can hardly make any impreſſion upon them; but he who can once poſſeſſe them with fear, may do what he will with them. Whence it is, that they are not ſo much to be perſwaded by reaſon, as forced by the apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of rigors inevitable, if they conſent not, to what is required of them. <hi>Tacitus</hi> in his Hiſtory doth notably well deſcribe theſe qualities of theirs, when he ſaith, That thought they have extraordinary forces, yet nothing is ſo cowardly, ſo fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, nor ſo wavering, if they be not led and animated by a generous Commander; That as they caſt themſelves upon enterpriſes with fury, ſo do they faintly abandon them, and fall into diſorder, upon their firſt apprehenſion of danger, and that holding no mean in their actions, whileſt they are fearleſſe, they are no ſooner at a ſtand, but they may be wrought to any thing. <hi>Titus Livy,</hi> ſpake with no leſſe knowledge of them, when he ſaid, the nature of a people is; either to ſerve too ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectly, or to command too inſolently, they being incapable of any <hi>medium.</hi> Now when is it that they command with too much inſolence, but when they find them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of the ſtronger party, and that they fear nothing? and on the other ſide, when do they creep with too much abjection and ſervitude, but when they are abaſed and pulled down by rigors or chaſtiſements? Upon this ground was it, that <hi>Druſus</hi> went into <hi>Panonia,</hi> to appeaſe a great ſedition; but finding all fair and gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle means were to no purpoſe, he made uſe of force and power, which they no ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner felt the ſmart of, but they returned to their former ſubmiſſion and obedience. Now the ſureſt and ſafeſt way to touch a people with fear is, not to be too haſty upon them in their firſt heat and fury; but to let that a little paſſe over, for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing doth more decreaſe and allay them then time; they being like the Sea, which of it ſelf is calm and quiet; yet however ſubject to great ſtorms and agitations, when the impetuous Winds begin to ſtir up its Waves, and to arm them with fury againſt one another, but returns to its own calmneſſe, when the winds once ceaſe to move it. Thus it is with the rabble, of themſelves they are not capable to act or ſtir, but when they ſuffer themſelves to be carried by the ſuggeſtions of ſome ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious, furious ſpirit; Oh how do they then rage and rave! No violent thing can laſt long, neither indeed can their fury hold out, if once they who firſt raiſed them, forbear to lead them; and then, if in this nick of time, they are threatned with puniſhments, and ſee a power able to force them, you may preſently lead them to what you will, ſo great an influence hath that Paſſion of fear, over their low and narrow hearts.</p>

The <hi>Sieur de Guron</hi> anſwered them, that it was in vain for them to hope the keeping up of their Fortifications, and that indeed they did much wrong themſelves, to ſtand ſo ſtifly in their own way, ſeeing the Cardinals word was a greater ſecurity then all their Walls and Works; and laſtly, that he could not be perſwaded, but that it was in their power to work the people to what was reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and fit, or elſe that they muſt look to ſuffer all poſſible extremities they could imagine.

An opportunity laid hold on, a Magiſtrate gained, a good credit inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuated into all men, a conſternation thrown amongſt a people; theſe and the like are the means with which Prudence driveth on all her deſigns; and by theſe it is, that ſhe brings greater things to paſſe then Armies and Multitudes, which without Prudence are nothing worth. Force of it ſelf, is blind, all the eyes it hath, is Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, without which, Force doth moſt commonly run into diſorder. Whereupon the Poets feigned that <hi>Jupiter</hi> fore ſeeing the Gods intended to Revolt, and ſeiſe upon his perſon, took advice of <hi>Pallas,</hi> before ever he ſent to <hi>Briarius</hi> with his hundred hands to defend him: Signifying, that Prudence keeps the key of all thoſe Springs which move Force, and that without it, Force onely ſerves to ruine thoſe who imploy it. A great Genius hath certain Engines and Springs by which he wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth, as it were inviſibly, and the effects he produceth, are the more admirable; becauſe vulgar ſpirits not ſeeing how it is done, are the more ſurpriſed at it.

The Marſhal <hi>de Baſſompierre,</hi> entred with part of the army to take poſſeſſion of the Town, and the next day the Cardinal marched in, to the peoples great joy and acclamation. The Conſuls, the Corporations of the City, and the Juſtice went out a League from the City to meet him; where the firſt Conſul, and the Lievtenant Criminal, made ſpeeches to him, teſtifying their joy to ſee him, and how much they were tranſported with the apprehenſion of thoſe favours which they had already received from him, and what confidence they had in his goodneſs, for the continuation of his kindneſſes unto them. It cannot be imagined with what honour they received him; nay they offered him the Cloath of State but he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed it, notwithſtanding their inſtances; and telling him, they deſired then to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry it before him, which was uſual, when any Governours or Lievtenants of Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces came into a City; but he abſolutely denied it: neither would he that the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuls ſhould walk on foot by his horſe, but deſired them to attend at his lodging, whileſt he went to the Church, ſeeing they were not of the ſame Religion. He went directly to the Church, which was onely covered with Tyles, it having been ruined by the Heretiques, where he ſung the <hi>Te Deum,</hi> aſſiſted by all that could throng in, as well Catholicks as Hugonots, ſo much were they delighted to behold him; and indeed his ſweetneſſe, his agreeableneſſe, his Civility, and the Bounty which his word and behaviour teſtified to all the World, did not a little captivate them, and charm their courages. Thence he went to alight at the lodging which had been prepared for him, where the whole Town waited to receive him; he enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained them with ſuch familiarity and freedome, that they could never enough be ſatisfied with his ſight: And that I may the better deſcribe the content they took

                  <p>ARms are not all the means, for the obtaining of victories, Prudence hath ſome; if the victory be nothing but the attainment of that end, for which a War is began; and provided that a man once Maſter his deſign, what matter is it whether it be by one or t'other.

                  <p>AT this time <hi>France</hi> was happy indeed having overcome that Monſter called Hereſie which had been long conquering; The Power of <hi>France</hi> was now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the greater, in regard, it was not divided, as heretofore, within it ſelf. Thoſe Forces which had of late ſo often drew their Swords within their own Country, were now at Liberty to be employed abroad in defence of the Allyes of the Crown; The houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> was no longer ſuch a Bugbear, neither was there any fear of diſcontented perſons; Who formerly, with the help of fifty thouſand Crowns, could
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:56802:153"/>raiſe a civil War, at their own pleaſures. Thoſe great Taxes did now ceaſe, which were of neceſſity to be kept on foot, whilſt the Kingdome was governed at ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. Thoſe Expenſes which the State was forced to bear, for the ſuppreſſing the Hugonots, in Penſions, Fortifications, Garriſons, Colledges and the like, were now layed up: The King was abſolute Maſter of <hi>Poictou, Guyenne, Languedoc</hi> and <hi>Dauphinè,</hi> which formerly he had only at ſix and ſeven. But how much then was the whole Nation beholding unto the Cardinal, ſeeing the King had principally made uſe of his Prudence and Courage, to bring all theſe glorious things to paſſe, as his Majeſty himſelf, had often publiſhed and declared in his letters, and on many other occaſions? There cannot be any reaſonable, indifferent Judg, but will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, he deſerved all monuments, both of Honour and Glory, and that ſuch as ſhould be ingrateful, for theſe his ſervices, or attempt to procure him any diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, ought to be puniſhed with ſhame and confuſion. But alas, that Paſſion of Private Intereſt, like a thick vail, which takes away the ſight, would not let thoſe of the Cabal, neer the Queen Mother, behold his deſerts, and the praiſes which were due to him; But on the contrary, led them to take advantages by his abſence, to invent new devices, and contrive ſundry Artifices, whereby they might incenſe that great Princeſſe againſt him. If the King acted any thing, not agreeable with her humour, preſently ſome one or other would acquaint her with it, and add; It was the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals doings. When once they perceived, that ſhe began to be jealous, becauſe his Majeſty did no longer follow her Counſels, (which indeed were not much to be commended) they were never quiet until they had entertained her with ſome diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to that purpoſe, which might blow the Coals of her paſſion and diſcontent. If at any time ſhe could not preſently effect, whatever ſhe deſigned, then the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals power was to be lamented either by words at length, or (perchance becauſe that was not at all times permitted) by the language of their Eyes, no leſſe power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful than the other.

But who could endure that they ſhould thus employ their time, whiles he employed his in procuring the Kings glory and the happineſs of <hi>France?</hi> Had he been then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, they never durſt have been ſo bold, but his frequent abſence was that which gave them opportunities to embitter the Queen Mother againſt him, who formerly had a great reſpect for him. They raiſed her anger to ſuch an height, before ſhe was aware of it, that upon the Cardinals return from <hi>Montauban</hi> to <hi>Fountainbleau,</hi> ſhe could no longer conceale her diſcontent, her eyes darting anger, which formerly were pleaſant toward him; her eyes dar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>ABſence hath alwayes been known to be very prejudicial to Court favourites, It is difficult for them to be long away, and that ſome one or other raiſe not a faction againſt them, eſpecially the Women, whoſe affection being more guided by ſence than reaſon, verifies that Proverb, <hi>Out of ſight and out of mind.</hi> Their memory is treacherous, and they who are not in their ſight, are eaſily removed out of their favours. Importunity worketh more upon them then merit, and he who deſires to be Maſter of their affections, muſt neceſſarily be continually in their ſight. The Spaniard hath a Proverb, much to this purpoſe and a good one it is, <hi>Women do eaſily blot out of the roul of their friends, thoſe who are either dead or abſent.</hi> But admitting this were not ſo, yet the envy of thoſe, who appertain to great men, never permits them to loſe the opportunity of any abſence, without attempting their ruine; The eminence of a Favourites genius, or the virtues which ſhine in him, are not able to ſecure him, for envy is a paſſion ſo maligne, that thoſe perſons who have moſt reputation, true worth and glory, are the uſual objects of it. Whence one of the moſt famous Captains among the <hi>Ancients</hi> ſaid; He for his part thought that he had not yet done any thing praiſe worthy, becauſe that envy that
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:56802:154"/>companion of virtue, had not found him out. It is true the ſervices and generous actions which they atchieve for the glory of a State, do ſometimes raiſe them to ſo high a degree of honour and repute, that the deſpair of bettering them, ſecures them from the emulation of others, but it never exempteth them from hatred. There is an inevitable neceſſity, that they who bear a great ſway in a Government ſhould be hated, not onely, becauſe men borne free are carried by a certain natural inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to hate thoſe who command them, but alſo becauſe there are divers perſons of the Court, who flatter themſelves, that they deſerve more Honour than they have, and that they who Govern the affairs, depriving them of that which is their due, do attempt to hurt them: Such people are they, who blame the Sun, becauſe they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not confidently look upon him, but conſider not that the fault is in their eyes, not his luſtre. They can no more endure the ſight of an extraordinary virtue, than that of a bright Star, were it not for the night they would hardly know what the day is, and it is the glimmering of the Moon and Stars, which doth onely teach them what eſteem they ought to have of the greatneſs and power of the Sun: ſuch maligne Spirits there are, who are excellent at nothing but finding faults, that they are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent at, who never ceaſe to contrive the downfal of others; and onely becauſe they want merit to advance themſelves. But happy is that Miniſter, whoſe favour is chiefly grounded upon his Princes knowledge of his ſervices, upon his Princes ſence of the encreaſe of his glory, upon his Princes affections, which are no leſſe aſſured to him in his abſence then when he is preſent. Happy is the Miniſter then, when his Maſter looks upon him as the Sun, which hath no leſſe virtue or light, when it is furtheſt from us, then when it is neareſt to us.</p>

                  <p>JT is a very unjuſt act in a Prince to force thoſe Paſſages which are in his Allies Countries. It is an act full of hoſtility, not to be uſed but toward an enemy. I condemn it for unjuſt according to the judgement of the Theſſalians, who when they oppoſed themſelves againſt <hi>Braſidas,</hi> deſirous to paſſe through their Country to fight againſt the Athenians, told him, as <hi>Thucid<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>des</hi> relateth it. That he who forced a paſſage without their knowledge to whom it belonged, did an unjuſt act. Every one that hath power in his hand, ought not to exerciſe it in out-rages and violence againſt his neighbours, ſeeing he hath onely received it from Heaven for his juſt defence. The Romans were hertofore much commended, for that they never invade any Country, no not their enemies, without firſt proclaiming a War; ſo far were they from ſeizing upon any thing which belonged to their friends. If the Romans did at any time pretend to any thing which was their neighbours, they ſent their Embaſſadours to demand it; if within three days after demand made, it were not delivered, they denounced the War; neither then did they enter upon them, but after many Ceremonies, which are deſcribed in <hi>Titus Livy.</hi> But that we may not go ſo far back, did not the Heralds of <hi>Florence,</hi> and that not above three hundred years ſince, declare War againſt their enemies with Ceremonies much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that kind? Thoſe ancient forms (indeed) are now no longer in uſe; but yet that Prince who ſeizeth upon any Paſſages or Towns without it, cannot be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered but as an Uſurper. But ambition is now grown to that paſſe, that it is enough be the means what they will, ſo they ſerve his deſigns, without conſidering that divine Juſtice throws down, whatever is founded upon injuſtice; that as the Laws of man do puniſh private Thefts, ſo God the judge of Kings, will chaſtiſe their uſurpations; that they who indeavor to grow great by violence will at laſt meet their own ruine in a greater, and that the greatneſſe which is obtained by injuſtice, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not long laſt, though force uphold it for the preſent.</p>

                  <p>SEEing Embaſſadours repreſent their Maſters perſons, they cannot be affronted (without great injuſtice) by any Prince who is not in open War with him. He who doth otherwiſe, breaks that Law which is ſo generally received among all States, and injureth the perſon of his Maſter. He is guilty of an outrage, ſeeing their perſons have been alwaies eſteemed inviolable; and (as <hi>Tacitus</hi> ſaith) it is rarely ſeen among enemies, that Embaſſadours are ill treated. Beſides, how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy a thing is it to affront ſuch perſons who can neither defend nor revenge themſelves, but onely diſpute it by reaſon. All that can be done toward an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadour, from whom one hath received an injury, is to licenſe his departure without permitting any injury to be done unto him. Thus did the Romans to the King of <hi>Perſia</hi>'s Embaſſadours, they gave them eleven days to depart out of <hi>Italy,</hi> with order to tell their Maſter, that the Conſul <hi>Publius Licinius,</hi> ſhould ſhortly be in <hi>Macedonia</hi> at the head of their Army, to whom he might hereafter ſend his Embaſſadours, if he had any thing to propoſe to them, and not put himſelf to the trouble of ſending them to <hi>Rome,</hi> where they ſhould be no more received. They likewiſe ordered <hi>Sp. Carilius,</hi> to conduct them out of <hi>Italy</hi> to their ſhips (as <hi>Titus Livy</hi> reporteth.) And the late King <hi>Henry</hi> the great, whoſe conduct may ſerve for a Preſident to other Princes, hath ſhewed us a rare example of that reſpect which ought to be uſed toward Embaſſadours, when he diſcovered that <hi>Taſſas &amp; Dom Balthaſar de Cuniga</hi> his Succeſſour, Embaſſadours of <hi>Spain,</hi> held intelligence with <hi>Haſte</hi> and <hi>Merargues,</hi> he had more regard to the Law of Nations, then to their ſedicious practiſes, which in reaſon might have paſſed for acts of hoſtility. To in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure or impriſon an Embaſſadour in times of Peace cannot be done without inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, neither can there be other reaſon for it, then for the ſatisfying of ſome ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious and raſh pretences.</p>

In ſhort, Princes ought never to be ſo ex-aſperated in their differences, as not to ſeek the good of Peace, by ſome means of agreement, by their mutual giving one another to underſtand their Intentions, by their Ambaſſadors. He who undertaketh to carry all things, by a high hand, forceth all others to flye no extremities, which are accompanied with great Evils. The diſtance which is between Princes, is oftentimes the Cauſe of miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>underſtandings between them; but their Ambaſſadors acquainting each other, with the Juſtice of their Intentions, doth not a little allay their Angers and diſpoſe them to ſweetneſs. The Wiſe, admit not of any injuſtice; and though they are free from obedience to others, yet will they be ſubjected to reaſon. They know, true great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs doth not ſo much conſiſt in the power to do what they will, as what they ought: Neither do they meaſure their greatneſs, by the licentiouſneſs of ſatisfying their own paſſions, but by their power to do that which is Juſt. It is their glory, to make it appear, that though they can do all, yet they will not act any thing but what is commendable: Whence it comes, that firſt putting themſelves in the wayes of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, they do not afterwards ſcruple to ſollicite others to do the like. Thus likewiſe is it not an act of Lowneſs, but of great Prudence, and Civility, which Princes owe to each other.</p>

                  <p>SEeing the Laws of prudence adviſe us to raiſe advantage; as well from our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies as friends, I cannot be blamed if I obſerve from the practiſe of the houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> who after they had diſunited the Griſons from the <hi>Swizzers,</hi> endeavoured to raiſe diviſion amongſt the <hi>Swizzers</hi> themſelves, that the beſt means to weaken ones Neighbours, to ſeize on their Countries, or at leaſt to make uſe to their paſſages as occaſion ſhall ſerve, without their being able to prevent it, is to raiſe ſome divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion amongſt them. The good intelligence of a people is the principal ſtrength of a Kingdome, and their diſ-union is the cauſe of their ruin whence <hi>Lycurgus</hi> aſſured the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> that nothing could ſo much contribute to the encreaſe and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of their State, as an invincible courage againſt their enemies, and an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violable concord among themſelves. The deviſe which <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Macedon,</hi> made uſe of to overcome the <hi>Precians,</hi> was the fomenting of ſome differences between them; he aſſiſted one part of them againſt the other, and ſo long preſerved the diviſion between them, till at laſt they were both eaſily to be overcome; and who knoweth not that, that which heretofore brought <hi>France</hi> into the power of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> was onely the diviſion which the houſe of <hi>Burgonie,</hi> and ſeveral other Countries had raiſed within it? The Stars which are in an ill aſpect, cannot but produce very ill conſequences here below; ſo likewiſe when confederated Provinces ſhall begin to look awry one upon another and with animoſity; they cannot but endanger one another. The ſtatelieſt Palaces are ſoon ruined by little cracks and the greateſt peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple by ſmall diviſions. I might inſert here that the greatneſs of the God-head con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in its unity, and that if it could be divided, it would not be infinite. Thus that which renders a State invincible is concord; and that which deſtroyeth a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome is diviſion, that ſame thing too that it doth in publick, it doth in private families.</p>

A General ought to reſpect nothing more then his Honour; now there is not any one thing which can more obſcure it, then Infidelity, which breaketh the Juſtice of Military Act, which gives a Liberty, to do any unreaſonable thing, and converts War into Pyracy. He who would have his Souldiers be true to him, muſt be Juſt to his Enemies; Neither may he recede from one ſingle word paſſed to them: Beſides he is ſo much the more bound to the obſervance of it, as it is of conſequence to them.

                  <p>THere is not any thing more dangerous, then to ſuffer a potent Ambitious King, to ſeize on a Neighbour Princes Country by violence; ſeeing his conqueſt will only ſerve for a Bridge to the next Kingdome. An Ambitious King is like a great River; ever eating into it's Banks, without regard had either to the Juſtice or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice of his deſigns: When he hath once propoſed his end, he careth not by what means it is atchieved: His chief care is, how to make a party in his Neighbours Country, how to raiſe a diviſion, which may open an entrance for his Ambitious deſigns: He ſpareth no coſt to corrupt their Officers and Miniſters, He is like ſome people in <hi>Affrick,</hi> who ſleep with their eyes alwayes open; and as he believeth the greateſt glory, to conſiſt in poſſeſſing the greateſt empire, ſo he imagineth the deſign of Command to be a juſt cauſe of War; If his Forces be not ſtrong enough, he bloweth diviſion amongſt his Neighbours to make them revolt, and maketh uſe of thoſe who are credulous, that he may ſubject their fellows to his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion.

                  <p>Which being thus, who can be ignorant of the obligation which lyeth upon all Allyes to aſſiſt one another, when any attempt is made upon any ſingle Country amongſt them? The aſſiſtance which they lend is a ſecurity to their own States, and in fighting for him, they confirm their own quiet: But above all, they who are neareſt bordering upon one another, ought to be careful in this particular, becauſe they run a greater hazard.

Now though the King ſeemed to have a good eſteem of this Princeſſe, yet however the rule which he had alwayes impoſed on himſelf to give the Queen Mother al content obliged him to forbid; and reſpect and obedience the other, to accept of it; but which ſuch diſcontent it was, that unable longer to ſtay at Court, he retired into <hi>Lorain.</hi> The Duke of <hi>Lorain</hi> received him with great Honour, whether it were becauſe he was bound to reſpect him, or becauſe himſelf being already diſcontented with France, and of the Spaniſh faction, did hope to find ſome occaſion to ſatisfie his own hatred.

I may add that they endeavoured from that time more then ever to raiſe diſtruſts in him againſt the King and the Cardinal, whereby they might poſſeſſe him with fear, and they became ſo much the more conſiderable unto him, in that they found means to oblige him to look upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as the onely means of his ſafety: They having been thus, the principal cauſes of his departure, deſerved much more to be blamed then he did; becauſe he having once confided in them, it would be an hard matter for him to defend himſelf from their treacheries. The Queen Mother was not to be excuſed, ſhee having ſomething contributed to drive him into theſe extremities, which could be advantagious to no one, but very dangerous to <hi>France,</hi> as experience hath made it appear; and withal the Cabal which was then at Court, having grounded all thoſe broils which ſince hapned upon his departure. The Cardinal foreſaw the ill conſequences, if not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medied, therefore he omitted nothing in his power, which might induce his Majeſty to ſollicite him to return; but the diſcontents of Grandees are like thoſe ſickneſſes which muſt neceſſarily have their courſe, and cannot be cured until the natural heat hath overpowered the maligne powers in the body, ſo there was a neceſſity of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting what time might produce, that he might be perſwaded to return.</p>

The Allies of the Crown were left to the mercie of their enemies, of whom the Kingdome ſtood in fear.

In ſhort, the whole body of <hi>France</hi> heretofore ſick and lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing, began to recover ſtrength, with aſſurance of perfect health, when as its Forraign and Domeſtick enemies did not at all divert the Cardinals deſigns. All theſe things were ſo apparent, that the Cimmerian darkneſſe could not hinder the ſight of them, but who knows not that the ſtrongeſt reaſons cannot touch them, who are over-maſtered with Paſſion, as we have reaſon to beleeve they could not thoſe about <hi>Monſieur,</hi> ſeeing they were ſo blind in perſwading him to a courſe ſo directly contrary to that which the Cardinal had projected for the eſtabliſhment of the Kingdom? They ſhould have learned that as the Planets do not immit their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences here beneath, without cauſing of great alterations in the world; ſo neither do the Princes of the Blood ever ſeparate themſelves from their King and Country, but they cauſe great troubles and diſorders, and in caſe there were any others in the State, this were to remedy it by a worſe, a thing contrary to the Laws of Prudence; but a thing not much by them regarded, ſo they could but overcome their Maſters ſpirit, that they might afterwards lead him to whatever they deſired.</p>

                  <p>IF Divine Providence doth not appear with more ſplendour in any one thing, then the Government of the Univerſe; then true it is, that humane wiſedom is never more admirable then in the Conduct of Kingdomes, eſpecially when they are fallen from their firſt height, and that there is a neceſſity to re-eſtabliſh them. This re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtabliſhment doth undeniably depend upon that particular Miniſter who governeth affairs, next under the Authority of his Prince; for he is in the State, as the Sun in the World, as the eye to the Body, and as the <hi>Primum mobile</hi> among the Heavens. Yet however two truths cannot be gain-ſaid, the firſt is, that a State being a ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of free men, who not exactly following the motions which their chief miniſter gives them, it cannot be avoided but that ſome diſorder muſt follow, unleſſe divers others beſides himſelf be aſſiſtant. The principal cauſes ſhare indeed the chief glory in producing their effects, but not of being the onely producers of them, and the Sun himſelf could not enamel the earth with the Flowers of the Spring, unleſſe other cauſes did co-operate; and as no Labourer how vigilant ſoever can hinder the fields from producing Weeds; ſo it is likewiſe impoſſible that a chief Miniſter how prudent ſoever, ſhould ſo ſettle a State that no diſorder ſhould appear in it, ſeeing it is no leſſe natural for people to he unruly, then for the earth to bring forth weeds. The ſecond, that it is a work of time to re-eſtabliſh a State once fallen in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to confuſion. Nature works ſlowly, produceth the ſeed out of the grain, the ſien from the ſeed, the tree from the ſien, the flower from the tree, and at laſt the fruit. Thus likewiſe a Miniſter of State, how excellent ſoever he be, cannot reduce confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion into order, but by little and little, and by ſetting his Engines on work one af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter another. There muſt needs be ſome time ſpent in inquiring into the true cauſes of theſe evils, it being impoſſible to apply convenient remedies without diſcovering the original defect. He had need be inſtructed with Prudence and experience to conſider thoſe things which have heretofore conduced to make that State flouriſh, which he would now reſtore, and alſo that which hath been glorious for other States. He ought to imitate good Phyſitians, who having obſerved thoſe ill humours which cauſe the ſickneſſe, uſe their art firſt to purge them out, and then to bring their Patient to a good temper. The principal cauſes of the ruine of a State, are civil Wars, diſreſpect of authority, the too great Power of Princes of the Blood, Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers and Governours, Factions, negligence in Judges to puniſh publick diſorders, want of good Diſcipline among Souldiers, and the oppreſſures of the people: now what a deal of time muſt there be to redreſſe all theſe and eſtabliſh one quite contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry? It cannot be done but by time and labour, nay impoſſible, if the Kingdom be either in civil or forraign War. Laſtly, the Miniſter hath need of ſome time to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the neighbour Countries into ſuch a condition that they may not indanger his. Phyſitians are carefull for the reſtoring of their Patient to perfect health, that neither the ayr, nor any thing about him, may be offenſive to him, and a Prudent Miniſter is no leſſe obliged to be carefull; not onely that his neighbours may not injure him, but that they may be ſerviceable to him. He muſt keep a ſtrict intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence with his Allies, not injuring them, but aſſiſting them in all occaſions, as the Romans did, who ſent their Embaſſadours from Town to Town, to make a friendſhip with them, and to divert them from the Carthaginians. He ought to indeavour the breaking off all Leagues between forraign Princes, whoſe ſtrength by their uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting might become ſuſpected, whence it follows, that he ought not to be over-haſty in extinguiſhing any Wars between them; nay ſome he is bound to foment, as <hi>Lewis</hi> the Eleventh did, to divert thoſe ſtorms, which elſe would have fallen upon <hi>France.</hi> Theſe are the chief means which can contribute to the eſtabliſhment of a State; but who ſeeth not that amongſt a thouſand different cauſes, it is impoſſible totally to effect it, unleſſe after a long time, and with extream care and diligence.</p>

                  <p>THey of the Queen Mothers faction, would by no means let ſlip <hi>Monſieur's</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat, without making advantage of it. They deſpaired of ever overcoming his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, conſidering how great an eſteem be profeſſed to have of the Cardinals ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices; They very well knew, that the Queen Mother could not countenance any one againſt him, ſo powerfully, as <hi>Monſieur,</hi> whereupon they did their utmoſt, to breed a good underſtanding between them; and when his Majeſty had ſent divers to <hi>Monſieur,</hi> they did at laſt work the Queen Mother, to procure <hi>Marillac</hi> to be ſent to him, a perſon whom they knew to be fit for their deſign. The Cardinal gave him his inſtructions, as to what he ſhould ſay from his Majeſty, which tended to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member him, how really his Majeſty did affect him heretofore; to aſſure him, he was not at all altered at that preſent; That his Majeſty did not complain of him for his departure, but of his Servants, who had perſwaded him to it, and that he was ſo much the more obliged to return with ſpeed, becauſe all <hi>Europe</hi> would blame him, in caſe the Emperor and Spaniard ſhould make any great progreſſe in <hi>Italy,</hi> whilſt his Majeſty ſtayed at <hi>Paris</hi> in Expectation onely of his comming thither. The Cardinal alſo conſidering, how lately he had obliged <hi>Marillac,</hi> by procuring the Marſhals ſtaffe for him, could not ſuſpect any double dealing from him, whereupon he very earneſtly recommended this one thing more to him, that he would teſtifie to <hi>Monſieur</hi> how deſirous he was to ſerve him, and to aſſure him, that next to the preſervation of his Maſters favour, he had not any greater ambition, the of being known for his moſt humble and faithful Servant. But he inſtead of performing any tittle of this ſecond Commiſſion, no leſſe important for the good of <hi>France,</hi> then the former, only diſcourſed to him, of the great power this Grand Miniſter had in the Kingdome; concerning the many ſtrong places in his Government; of the great Expences he made, and thoſe vaſt benefits which the King beſtowed on him; he well knew this to be the only way, to provoke him unto Jealouſie, and to encreaſe thoſe diſguſts which he had already conceived againſt him, which were ſtill fomented by thoſe who were about him. Indeed he did not quite forget to tell him, that the Cardinal recommended his very humble ſervice to him; but <hi>Monſieur</hi> asking whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he would paſſe his word for performance of it, replied No; by which and the like anſwers he raiſed ſo great a diſtruſt againſt him, that it was impoſſible to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade him to return to his Majeſty, until the Cardinal had paſſed the Alpes.</p>

                  <p>PRudence and Fidelity are two of the moſt neceſſary qualities in a perſon, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in Negotiation of Affairs; The former to ſerve, the ſecond to prevent all diſſervice to him who employeth. He who tranſacteth any affair without Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, is like a Workman without Art; well may he have his Tools, but he knows not how to uſe them, and juſt as a Workman marrs his ſubject matter, if he know not what form to give it, ſo doth an Imprudent Negociator, ruin both publique and private affairs, committed to his charge and care; for Prudence ought to be his guide, the Conduct of his thoughts and words, and the ſquare by which he ruleth his Actions; without it there is not the leaſt hope of a good ſucceſſe. Now although this vertue be thus and thus neceſſary, yet fidelity is in ſome ſort, much more; By fidelity I mean, a firm conſtancy, and an unalterable reſolution to ſerve them who ſet him on work; Without this, all the Abilities and Prudencies in the world are not worth one Ruſh; For admit Prudence inlightneth his Soul, yet fidelity is that which guideth his deſires; though Prudence tell him what are the fitteſt wayes to obtain the end of his Commiſſion, yet it is fidelity which preſerveth him from turning ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the right or left, after any particular advantages; and if Prudence preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth him from being cheated and deceived, yet ſtill fidelity defendeth him from all by Intereſts. Fidelity teacheth all men, that a Negociator ought not to look upon
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:56802:161"/>what lyeth in his power, but upon what his faith obligeth him, which is, the inviola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble preſervation of his Intereſts who employeth him, and that with ſo ſacred a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, that no paſſion prevail upon him, to divert him from it.</p>
                  <p>Breach of Truſt is a fault ſo much the more odious in a Negotiator, becauſe pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blique affairs are entruſted with his integrity. Now for the choiſe of ſuch perſons, moſt fit for this kind of employment, I am of opinion, that they who are of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different Temper, and of an approved honeſty, are much more proper, then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined crafty men. The former are much more capable of a true affection; They will at leaſt ſtick cloſe to every tittle in their Inſtructions, and return a right and exact accompt of the State of affairs, where they are ſent: Whereas the latter, are apt to refine every thing, and to imagine, that only to propoſe what they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, is too little. They are commonly addicted to ingage themſelves in a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand things, if they concur with their particular inclinations, or Intereſts, inſtead of adhering barely to that which is given them in charge.</p>

                  <p>IT is very dangerous to allot any chief Provinces for <hi>Appanage</hi> to the Princes of the Blond. Their Birth renders them great enough, neither need they any additions of Honour, eſpecially ſuch which may ſerve them to make revolts, which commonly draw their ruine with them, if their Kings rule as they ought to do.

He who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſteth them with power, raiſeth a dangerous enemy againſt himſelf. The Sun is but one, and all the Stars receive their light from him; yet upon condition that he may at his pleaſure deprive them again of that ſplendour; juſt ſo is it with Princes, their greatneſſe proceedeth from the King, and he may deſpoil them of all their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour in a moment if once they recede from the due reſpect they owe unto him. The Riches which he beſtoweth on them, are for the diſcharging of thoſe expences which are proper for perſons of their eminency, not for the upholding of Factions, and abetting of Revolts.

                  <p>THe ſpirit of diviſion which had till then kept <hi>Monſieur</hi> from the King, gave great hopes to the enemies of the State, to advance their deſigns in <hi>Italy.</hi> They doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted not of inflaming a civil War in <hi>France,</hi> which might ſo divert his Majeſties Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, that he could not have the leiſure to come up to them a ſecond time. The Duke of <hi>Lorain</hi> offered <hi>Monſieur</hi> as many forces and money as he could deſire, and the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> who never yet eſcaped a broil, ſent twice to him to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain, that he being ſo much his ſervant, he ſhould take any other country for his retreat, and to offer him his, with proteſtation of quitting the Soveraign authority to him; nay, that he would even forſake it, to make him abſolute Maſter thereof, as alſo of himſelf and children to be diſpoſed at his Will and Pleaſure. Theſe Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers were ſufficient to have charmed any Soul, had he been at that time ſo diſtruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full as after he was; but he rather choſe to follow thoſe juſt reaſons which the King had propoſed to him, and to ſubmit himſelf to his pleaſure. All that forraign facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was wonderfully ſurpriſed at the news of his accommodation; and the Cardinal who ſtayed his Army from advancing into <hi>Italy,</hi> onely in expectation of his return, perſwaded his Majeſty no longer to defer his reſolution, that the Spaniards might not make any further progreſſe. The King deſired to go in perſon, he being too couragious to entertain himſelf in a Chamber, whiles his Armies were in the field. But the Cardinal who foreſaw that the unſeaſonableneſs of the time might indanger him, adviſed him to ſtay ſome time, and offered himſelf to undertake that imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The King received this Propoſition as an aſſured teſtimony of his fidelity, but ſuch &amp; ſo tender was his affection to him, that he could hardly be perſwaded to part with him, he being as much grieved to conſent to his departure from him, as he was heretofore joyed for his return, as was ſeen by all the Court at <hi>Rochel, Privas,</hi> and <hi>Fountainbleau.</hi> Yet at laſt his Majeſty knowing how important the aſſiſting of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur de Mantua</hi> was, as alſo how much the glory of his Armies and Authority were concerned in it, could not intruſt them with any but the Cardinal, who was not onely the chief Miniſter in his Counſels, but alſo the greateſt Commander in his Kingdom. He knew in what reputation he was amongſt ſtrangers, &amp; what Courage his preſence infuſed into the Souldiery. Of his Prudence he was aſſured, having oftentimes ſeen his Enemies Plots diſcovered by him, &amp; prevented before ever they were ready to be put
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:56802:162"/>in execution. His good conduct too he could not be ignorant of, he having by often experiment found it to be exact and excellent, and ſuch as was to be preferred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore any other.

As ſoon as he had received his Commiſſion he departed from <hi>Paris,</hi> being about the latter end of the year, which his Majeſty intended to celebrate by as famous an Act as he began it.

                  <p>THe General of an Army being the ſecond perſon of a Kingdom, had need be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with all the qualities neceſſary to the King himſelf, but thoſe which do moſt contribute to his glory, and the good ſucceſſe of the Armies under his command, are Prudence, Courage and Reputation: Prudence is like the eye which beholds thoſe things that are proper to be done, and what is fit to be commanded; Courage is that which executeth them, and Reputation is like the ſoul in couragious Battels, which gives motion to the Souldiers with ſo extraordinary a generoſity, that it is eaſie to know, when they are commanded by a General in whom they have a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence. Prudence is neceſſary for him to deliberate with judgment, what is ſound and fit, and to command them to good purpoſe, which teacheth him to keep his Army in good order, which acquainteth him with the humour and diſpoſition not onely of thoſe Officers who command under him, but likewiſe of his Souldiers, that he may the more readily know how to command them upon his deſigns, which tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth him the obſervation of military Laws, which helpeth him to foreſee and prevent
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:56802:162"/>great dangers, which gives him means to judge of Treaties, and make advantages of them as occaſion ſhall happen; which furniſheth him with reſolution to proſecute his deſigns, with courage of mind to bear mis-fortunes and with moderation in good ſucceſſe. Theſe are ſome of thoſe effects of that Prudence which is requiſite in a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral. I could add a thouſand other ſubjects in which it is needfull, but for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, I ſhall onely ſay in general, terms that Prudence ought to be the rule by which he ſquareth all his actions. Thus did the Egyptians acknowledge it for an inſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable companion of command, whiles they repreſented it, by an eye placed over a Scepter. If a General have need of Prudence, ſurely Courage is no leſſe neceſſary for him, that he may break through all obſtacles which may happen for the aſſault<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his enemies with rigour; that he may adventure upon dangers without fear; that himſelf may be in the fights, and that in his own perſon he may lead up his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to infuſe the greater reſolutions in them. It is not that he ſhould raſhly run in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to dangers, but to look them in the face, and to ſend others on without apprehenſion of fear. It is an errour in young men who think that a General cannot be coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious, unleſſe he run madly into dangers; that were rather fury, and would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure him the diſcredit of being raſh, rather then the honour of being couragious. If he had an heart without judgement, to what purpoſe were it? He being the Soul of War, and others lives depending on his, he is bound to preſerve himſelf for the preſervation of others. Not that he ought to be abſent when orders are to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, or his Souldiers incouraged, but that he ought not to run headlong into the heat of the Battel, unleſſe when he finds the Victory wavering, and that his example is requiſite to renew the courage of his Souldiers, and to carry the day by ſome extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary attempt. In ſuch occaſions he may adventure himſelf, elſe not. His ſtaffe of command being to force others on, and the Sword in the Souldiers hand to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute his commands. Laſtly, Reputation is requiſite in a General, for without it, the Souldiers have not any confidence in him; whereas, when they once eſteem him, it intitles him to a greater power over them then any other thing, when they ſhall have oftentimes ſeen him break through dangers, they will not flinch at any thing. The Sun his vigour maketh all things the more fruitfull; and it is moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that the reputation of a General is that which makes him more reſplendant amongſt his forces, and adds a great life to his commands. The Souldier moves but by halfs under a low ſpirited Commander, and is hardly perſwaded to any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary enterpriſes. He ſeems onely to have Arms for his own defence; but when his Commander is a perſon of reputation, it is far otherwiſe. I am of the ſame judgement with him, who ſaid, Opinion hath ſo great an Empire, that it governs the whole world; at leaſt it is ſo far true, for that virtue her ſelf would have but ſmall authority in commanding, without being beholding to her. Thus an ancient, and that wiſely, held that the happineſſe of ſucceſſe, was the daughter of au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and of the reputation of great men.</p>

               <p>IF Antiquity hath made <hi>Afrique</hi> to paſſe for one of the moſt wonderfull Countries of the World; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it every day produceth ſomething, which is both new and Monſtrous, I am moſt confident that this years Hiſtory will enforce the judgments, of thoſe who ſhall conſider it to confeſſe, that <hi>Europe</hi> runs the ſame Parallel: and the extraordinary di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity which is here met with, is ground enough for it, ſeeing every Sun brings to light, ſomewhat which is not common, and ſeems to give a new face to all State affairs. <hi>Bellona</hi> ſets all parts on fire with the flames of War. Peace endeavoured which all it's might to extinguiſh it in <hi>Italy:</hi> Honour and diſgrace breed ſtrange effects; Ingratitude will cauſe us to behold ſuch Monſters, that the Age to come will want faith to believe the qualities of them. Love and hatred, will a like ſtrenuouſly act their parts; The Stars of Heaven in their malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities one againſt t'other, ſeem to conſpire the ruin of Nations and Armies; In a word there is not any one thing which a man may call ſtrang or unheard of, but I

               <p>If ſhould ſeem that Heaven, which cannot juſtly be more admired at for any thing then that of its various twinking lights the Stars, is ſometimes delighted to ſhew us an extraordinary diverſity in Negotiations of States, and partly to afford thoſe who govern, fit opportunities to teſtifie their Prudence to the World: The Divine wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom permits their Splendor to be ſomtime Eclipſed with thick clouds, which are ſoon after diſſipated and blown over, to make their light appear the more glorious. Such is the condition both of Kingdoms and particular men, that they are both equally ſubject to the changes of Fortune. But as the wiſe and prudent Pilot ſaves and keeps his veſſel, in the greateſt and moſt violent ſtorm, not loſing his judgment, either at the flaſhes of lightning, or the claps of Thunder which cuts and rends the air on every ſide. So likewiſe a great Miniſter cannot be moved at any ſhocks of Fortune, his courage never permitting her to Triumph in the leaſt over his reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or to Byas him from the Laws of Prudence, the rule of all his conduct, and this it is you will find our Cardinal to practiſe in all and every the tranſactions of this year.</p>

                  <head>The Promotion of the Arch-biſhop of <hi>Lions,</hi> and <hi>Monſieur Bagny</hi> to the Cardinalſhip.</head>
                  <p>I Will begin with the Honours which the King procured his holineſs to beſtow, with, the Cardinals Hats on the Arch-biſhop of <hi>Lions,</hi> and <hi>Monſieur Bagny</hi> the Popes Nuntio. The great Worth of the former at the leaſt equalized that honour of the Cardinalſhip, and his ſublime vertue, made it apparent to all the World, that to have left him in the ſolitudes of a Cloyſter, had been a great injury and wrong to the whole Church. I ſhall not need ſay more of him, then that he was the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals Brother, ſeeing that qualification were ſufficient to render him capable of ſo eminent a dignity. The King who ſlips not any occaſion of acknowledging the ſervices which he had done both to his Perſon and Eſtate, could not endure to ſee him have a Brother in the Church, and not advanced to the utmoſt degree of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour which the French are capable of: and the Pope had but too much aſſurance and knowledge of the great advantages he had procured to the Church; ſo that he could not do leſſe then honour his Brother with a hat ſeeing it was not in his power to raiſe himſelf to any higher Eminency. Its true by the Laws of the Roman Court, it is not permitted that two Brothers be Cardinals at the ſame time: But as theſe Laws are not ſo conſiderable as thoſe of gratitude and acknowledgment, ſo his Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs did not ſo much as once ſcruple at it; And for that which concerns <hi>Monſieur de Bagny,</hi> beſides the cuſtome of ordinarily conferring the Cardinalſhip on ſuch as have for ſome time reſided neer his Majeſty, in the quality of his Holineſs Nuntio, which ſeems to give him ſome right or claim to the Hat; His own Worth, which rendered him deſerving in the judgments of all the Grandees in the Kingdom, not only of the Cardinalſhip, but even of the Papal Miter, every one predicting that he would one day wear is, invied, nay enforced the King to contribute his utmoſt to obtain it for him; and not only that but the quality of his Genius cauſed every one to conclude, that he would one day be very conſiderable in the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> when before he had arrived to that pitch of Honour, he could not but be very ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageouſly uſeful to the Intereſts of <hi>France,</hi> which upon frequent occaſions depend upon their well management in the Conſiſtory.</p>

                  <p>ALthough the Cardinals are not regarded in <hi>France,</hi> but as Princes who are ſtrangers. Yet this their promotion doth not render them leſſe uſeful or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant to the State; they being more conſiderable, then other Princes of the ſame
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:56802:164"/>condition, by reaſon of the affairs which are daily negotiated with his Holineſs the Pope, and indeed ought to be reſpected, as the principal conſervators under the King, of the Liberties and Franchiſes of the French Church and State; they being his Majeſties Chief Miniſters in Ordinary, neer the Pope: and it hath been alwayes held neceſſary, that there were ſome one of this quality, either a French man by Nation, or at leaſt very affectionate by Nature, to the Intereſts of <hi>France,</hi> who might cordially advance the deſigns and concerns of the French King and Church, with his Holineſs the Pope. And from hence it came to paſſe, that if they were naughty French, little affectionate either to the State or his Majeſties Perſon or infected with the <hi>Maximes</hi> of <hi>Spain,</hi> that great Inconveniences befell, as hath been heretofore ſeen; and for my particular I believe it to be ſafer for his Majeſty, to permit <hi>France</hi> to be with out any, rather then ſuch Cardinals. But we live not in an age, which hath any reaſon to complain of ſuch an unhappineſs, ſeeing <hi>France</hi> oweth the reſtaura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of its greatneſs and glory, to the Cardinal, as to the Prime and firſt of ſecond Cauſes, which Act under the King; for to him chiefly belongs the Honour, in that he had ſo great an influence upon the Popes diſpoſition, that he gave the Italians themſelves a juſt occaſion to ſay, that his Holineſs was turned Cardinal.</p>

                  <head>The diſpatch of the Marſhal <hi>d' Etree</hi> to the Commonwealth of <hi>Venice,</hi> concerning the Affairs of the Duke of <hi>Mantua.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>I Shall paſſe from the conſideration of thoſe reaſons of State, which might be made, upon the aforeſaid Lords Promotion to the Cardinalſhip, that <hi>I</hi> may tell you how about the end of the foregoing year; Fortune being become ſeldome fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable to the houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> or their Arms, the Imperialiſts found themſelves, ſo oppreſſed with diſeaſes, and incumbred with ſickneſſes and neceſſities, that they were enforced to raiſe the ſiege of <hi>Mantua.</hi> But it was as if they had only with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn themſelves into their Winter quarters. The Duke of <hi>Mantua</hi> was vigilant for the preſervation of his State, and well knew the ambitious humor of <hi>Spain,</hi> which had ſought all occaſions for fifty years paſt, to render themſelves Maſters of <hi>Italy,</hi> and would not now bee wanting to reaſſume their former deſign, in cauſing new Troops to come from <hi>Germany,</hi> and in giving better Orders and Inſtructions, then heretofore, that they might give new life to their intentions and deſigns. This moved him to make addreſſes to the King, that he would be pleaſed to interpoſe his Authority with the Venetians, to induce them to raiſe an Army, and make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Maſters of the field, which would diſcourage the Imperialiſts, to return or make any more approaches towards <hi>Mantua:</hi> This requeſt of his was granted, and the Marſhal <hi>d' Eſtree,</hi> diſpatched towards <hi>Venice</hi> about the beginning of <hi>January,</hi> to treat there, concerning thoſe ſuccours, with order to retirs himſelf into <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tua,</hi> after the concluſion of his Embaſſie, according as the Cardinal had perſwaded the King to be moſt proper, before he had began his Journy thither. And thus, it being buſineſs of no ſmall importance for the Venetians to hinder the Spaniard from ſeating himſelf ſo neer them as <hi>Mantua.</hi> (His Dominion, being like the Eagles Feathers, which frets and eateth away thoſe which are next and neereſt unto it,) they readily imbraced the protection of the ſaid Duke of <hi>Mantua,</hi> and choſe the Duke of <hi>Candal</hi> for their General, and gave him after many importunities continually ſuggeſted by the Marſhal <hi>d' Eſtree,</hi> about twelve thouſand foot, and three thouſand Horſe, to which were joyned the Regiments of <hi>Candale</hi> and <hi>Valette,</hi> which were about three thouſand men a piece ſent by the King.</p>

                  <p>IT is very neceſſary to know the deſigns of an Enemy, before he be in a condition to put them in Execution, and this foreſight is ſo much the more commendable, by how much it is profitable and commodious to the good of a Commonwealth.
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:56802:165"/>That Prince is much to be blamed, who begins to make preparations of defence, when he ſees an Armed Enemy at his Gates, and he is oftentimes well beaten for his negligence.</p>
                  <p>The preparations of War, which a Prince maketh in expectation of being aſſaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted or ſet upon, are a certain Index of his courage, and a ſure teſtimony of his reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, which allayes and cheques, the heat and fury of an Enemy, who may from thence gather, that he diſpoſeth himſelf in good earneſt to entertain the War, and that one thing is ſometimes capable of frighting them from making any incurſions or invaſions into a Country. It is very dangerous to deſpiſe an Enemy after a victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and as great a fault to ſlight him before a fight. Fear is ſtill attended with ſhame and confuſion, when it faintly withdraws from the Battle; But that which produceth no other effect in the Soul of a Prince, then the reſolution of preparation for the War when he finds himſelf threatned with an Invation, cannot but be allowable, honourable and commendable. On the otherſide, the little eſteem which a man hath of his Enemies, gives them a notable advantage, ſeeing it cauſeth a neglect of the keeping Forces in a condition of repelling Enemies, and gives them oportunities of time and place to advance, to fortifie and to put all their deſigns in Execution; ſo that it will be at laſt full as difficult to compel them to retire, as at firſt it had been eaſie to have ſtop't and impeded their entrance or approches. And this <hi>Maxime</hi> I learn from <hi>Caeſar,</hi> who inſtead of neglecting or ſlighting his Enemies, made his Souldiers alwayes believe that their Enemies were very ſtrong, that every one might diſpoſe himſelf to fight, either by redoubling his courage, or reſolving to preſerve himſelf in that Station and Orders, which his Officers ſhould allot and aſſign unto him.</p>

                  <p>IT is moſt true, the preſence of a King worketh ſtrange effects, in their Armies; there is a certain vivacity and gallantry of courage, which flows from their Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, which doth ſo ſtrongly animate their Souldiers reſolutions, that nothing is able to reſiſt them. The moſt generous are troubled in their feats, if they have not the eyes of a Prince for witneſſes of their actions, from whence they either hope for a glory or a reward: And the moſt cowardly, at the ſight of them, are touch't to the very Soul with ſuch a ſtrong influence and reſentment, that there is not any danger how great ſoever able to infuſe the leaſt fear into them, and they only apprehend a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of occaſions to ſignalize themſelves, before ſuch extraordinary teſtimonies of a great valour. The late King <hi>Heury</hi> the Great, ſhewed the World in ſix ſeveral encounters, how much valour his preſence inſtilled into his Souldiers, when with a handful of men he carried away the victory from the moſt puiſſant Armies of the Enemies of his Crown, moſt eſpecially in the Battails of <hi>Arques</hi> and <hi>Fontain-Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coiſe,</hi> where he gave a ſure teſtimony, that his only perſon was capable of vanquiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, though ſeconded with never ſo ſmall a Troop.

                  <p>ANger is a Paſſion, which forceth a man to undertake any thing, nay all things.

<pb n="322" facs="tcp:56802:166"/>which it propoſeth it ſelf. Anger is moſt Induſtrious and Vigilant upon every oportunity of offending thoſe whom it ayms at, and there is not any thing which it will not patiently endure, ſo that it may arrive to the end of its deſigns. Anger too, as it hath no fellowſhip with Prudence, but a great friendſhip with boldneſs, (which makes it hope and attempt the levelling of <hi>Mountains</hi>) ſo it doth frequently tumble thoſe whom it poſſeſſeth into thoſe pits, and ſnares which they had provided for others. Anger, hath alwayes its eyes and thoughts fix't upon the end of its deſigns, not once conſidering the difficulties, dangers or wickedneſſes, which accompany the means of obtaining its deſires. And it is apparently ſeen, that the minds of thoſe who are once tranſported with this Paſſion, reflect on nothing but how they may quench that fire with which they burn, concluding there is no other water to extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh it, then the ruin and downfal of thoſe whom they hate and maligne, little imagining that a Remedie of this quality will conſume them in a worſe heat, and render their diſeaſe the more tormenting.</p>

As ſoon as he was arrived at <hi>Lions,</hi> he would not loſe any longer time, but after he had writ to the King, that it was not expedient for his Majeſty to venture himſelf, conſidering the extreme ill ſeaſon of the year, he preſently diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched the <hi>Sieur de Servient,</hi> Superintendent of Juſtice in his Majeſties Army, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> to inform him that he was come with forty thouſand men, with deſign to aſſiſt the Duke of <hi>Mantua,</hi> and to defend him from the Spaniſh oppreſſion. His Highneſs was obliged by the Treaty of <hi>Suze,</hi> to joyne his forces with thoſe of the King for the preſervation of that Prince, and of the Liberty of <hi>Italy;</hi> and but a very little before he had renewed thoſe his promiſes to the King by the Preſident of <hi>Montfalcon,</hi> who had aſſured his Majeſty in his behalf, that he would advance ten thouſand men, and keep his Marts well provided with neceſſaries for the Souldiers; and all this that he might be as good as his promiſe. The time was now come, in which he muſt declare himſelf, and reduce his words into Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. The Cardinal commanded <hi>Monſieur de Servient</hi> to preſſe him to it in the King's behalf; The anſwer which the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> ſhould have made, if he had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded with that faith and truth, which ought to go hand in hand with the Promiſes of all confederate Princes had been this, that he would not go one tittle leſſe then his word; but inſtead of that fair and clear dealing, his firſt anſwer was, that he did totally diſown the Preſident of <hi>Montfalcon,</hi> without the leaſt ſhew of a readineſs to execute his promiſes, which gave evident cauſes of ſuſpition, that he held Intelligence with the Spaniard, and of which there had been former notice and adviſe given from other hands.</p>

                  <p>THe words of Princes ought to be as inviolate as the Sanctuary. Whatever con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence they apprehend in their affairs, is not a ſufficient ground for their dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble dealing; but they ought to blame their own fore-ſight. It is as diſhonourable for them to ſay, I did not think it, as it is glorious and noble for them to keep their words. That Prince cannot be thought faithfull, who will break his promiſe upon what occaſion ſoever it be, which whoſoever doth, deceiveth and cheateth himſelf; for that the truth and faith of Grandees, gives then as much power and credit, as their Swords. It is eſteemed by the moſt wiſe, to be a good Store-houſe or Armo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, when a King can aſſure himſelf of the aſſiſtance of all other Princes, which he may ſafely do, ſo long as they are reputed faithfull. But when any Prince becomes faithleſſe, it is lawfull for every one to break with him, who firſt breaks himſelf. He who hath been once treacherous, is for ever looked on as a Coward, the onely going back from his word, being an aſſured ſign that his fear of others is that which makes him abandon his own Allies.

The Cardinal very well knew there was nothing to be thought on, but to be done; that was, to open the Paſſages, and furniſh the Markets, as it had been reſolved on; ſo that after a full debate with himſelf, what honour he was bound to render to this Prince, being the Kings Brother-in-law, he concluded, that in going to confer with him, who had falſified his word, and intended nothing but to ſurprize him, he ſhould do an act quite contrary to the Kings Majeſties Grandeur, who had done him the honour to make him Lievtenant of his Army, ſo that he abſolutely declined this meeting; as well knowing, that the Duke of <hi>Savoy's</hi> deſign in it, was to amuſe and delay the Army in their march; and by this means to diſperſe and bring them by little and little to nothing; ſo the Cardinal advanced to <hi>Embrun,</hi> not being willing to come near <hi>Suze,</hi> leſt in caſe the Army ſhould want reſt, they ſhould there meet with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny inconveniences, and eat out all their ſtore of Proviſions.</p>

                  <p>IT cannot be denied but that it is a baſeneſſe in a General to go meet him who hath broke his word, and who deſigns in his interview, nothing more then the loſſe of his Army. If he will needs go meet him, let it be with his ſword in his hand, to chaſtiſe him for the injuries he hath done. I am of the ſame opinion with the
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:56802:167"/>Grand <hi>Coſmo de Medicis,</hi> who ſaid, a man may forgive his enemies their faults; but its fit to puniſh the offences of ſuch as call themſelves our friends, and under that notion betray us. But if a King, or he who repreſents his perſon, do not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire ſatisfaction, or to revenge the injuries which are offered unto them; yet it would be ignominious to go meet and confer with a Prince, who aims at nothing but his own intereſt and advantage. This were to be defective both in the Rules of Prudence and Valour. Beſides thoſe conferences of face to face, between incenſed Princes, do rather increaſe their hatred, then breed any hearty good will between them; and of this <hi>Plutarch</hi> hath well adjudged, upon that conference between <hi>Pompey</hi> and <hi>Lucullus.</hi> And <hi>Tacitus</hi> in his <hi>Annales,</hi> upon the meeting between <hi>Germanicus</hi> and <hi>Piſon.</hi> It's true, the place deſign'd by the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per enough, and ſuch as hath been ſometimes uſed between Princes and great Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders, who have choſen to meet upon Bridges, in the middeſt of which Rails and Barriers have been ſet up, to prevent any attempts of either party.

                  <p>BY this refuſal of the Cardinal, the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> concluded, that all his deſigns were diſcovered, and miſdoubting that a juſt puniſhment would follow, he had another trick to take to, which was, he granted the Paſſages and Marts, but in ſuch places as were acceſſible by none but Bears, and if thoſe were not approved of, he promiſed others, but with this reſerved reſolution, that he would ſo long delay the furniſhing the Army with Victuals and other neceſſaries, that in effect it ſhould not paſſe at all.

                  <p>AFter all this jugling, the Cardinal was forced to break with the Duke of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy,</hi> but his Courage was ſtill governed by his Prudence; though he did not beleeve that the Kings enemies would accept of thoſe very conditions of Peace which themſelves propoſed. Now the reaſon why he would not ſo ſoon break off the Treaty, was, becauſe he would caſt the blame on them and their party, and that the Kings Army might appear with more Juſtice on its ſide, who had proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted their deſires or Peace, ſo long as they might with their Honours endeavour the obtaining of it; moreover, that by this means he might pierce into their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns, as alſo to revictual <hi>Cazal,</hi> which he could not have done, ſhould he have fallen out with the Duke, as ſoon as there was an occaſion offered for it.

As ſoon as <hi>Cazal</hi> was thus victualled, and that he was not able to procure an honourable Peace, his Zeal and Courage for his Majeſty, was not then longer able to break the inſolencies of his enemies, which till then his Prudence and diſcretion cauſed him to paſſe by, and take no notice of at all.</p>

                  <p>IT is not alwaies fit to break off a Treaty of Peace, as ſoon as one diſpairs of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding it. But I think it very expedient, and a matter of great concernment to prolong it, as long as honourably one may, provided he get any advantage by it. And as <hi>Saluſt</hi> in his Oration of <hi>Philippus</hi> againſt <hi>Lepidus,</hi> hath well obſerved, a man ought principally to have a care that in Treaties he do not teſtifie his deſires of Peace, with too great an Ardour or Affection, becauſe that were an aſſured ſign of fear and weakneſſe, the knowledge of which gives a conſiderable advantage to ones enemies. Though in a Treaty of a Peace, a Prince reap no other benefit then

                  <p>I May not paſſe by the many conferences which the Cardinal had with the Prince of <hi>Piedmont,</hi> in which the Prince could ſay little in his own defence, for that the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> had promiſed the opening of the Paſſages, and furniſhing the Marts with neceſſary Proviſions. At laſt all occaſions of diſcontent were removed, and the Cardinal did no longer refuſe to ſee him. I am the willinger to be a little par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular in this affair, that the model of it may ſerve for Princes to guide themſelves by, in interviews of this kind. The main ends of the Prince of <hi>Piedmont</hi> drift were to ſift out the Cardinals deſigns in his diſcourſes, and to ſink into his thoughts, if he could find any manner of hopes, that the Cardinal would relinquiſh and wave the general Peace, with this belief, that Peradventure thoſe many inconveniences, which the Army had ſmarted for in their firſt Quarters, might have ſomewhat abated, and it might be altered, the Cardinals laſt reſolutions: But the Cardinal who well underſtood, both by his own diſcretion and experience, the ends of ſuch meetings and diſcourſes, eſpecially when ſuch perſons are concern'd in them, who in former procedures, have evidenced their intentions of lying on the Catch, ſo managed himſelf, and kept himſelf in ſo retired a garb, that the Prince of <hi>Pied<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont</hi> could not pick the leaſt advantage out of him. At firſt nothing of buſineſs was named, only Complements and Civilities. The Cardinal made his Excuſes, that he ſhould not firſt propoſe any thing, being obliged to pay that Honour to the Prince of <hi>Piedmont;</hi> that he might thereby learn what it was they would be at: And the Prince fearing to diſcover himſelf, would have ſlip't his Neck out of the Collar, and left all to the Cardinals Propoſals. The time was beſt ſpent in diſcourſing of the general Peace, after both Parties had made their propoſals.</p>
                  <p>However the Cardinal ſtuck cloſe to thoſe Articles, which he had propoſed on the Kings behalf, with this proviſionary promiſe, that if they were ratified, then the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> ſhould expect ſatisfaction from his Majeſty to whatever he ſhould deſire; more then this he would by no means diſcover telling, the Prince of <hi>Pied<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont</hi> very plainly, that for his part, as he was not at all curious to prie into their deſigns; ſo he could not think it ſtrange, that he did not diſcourſe to him his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties intentions and reſolutions.</p>

In brief, If a States-man would have his affairs to ſucceed according to his deſigns, it were requiſite that he got the repute of being a Frank, open, generous perſon, and a ſpeaker of truth, otherwiſe his words will not be belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, and are look't upon as no way tending to the deſign he hath, which is in effect to perſwade his Enemies, that his Intention are quite contrary to his meaning: He ought alſo to be ſecret, not to ſpeak one tittle of his deſigns. And laſtly, he muſt make himſelf a Maſter in the Art of diſſimulation, feigning to watch every thing and place, but that which really he doth, and by his diſcourſe ſlyly indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to perſwade his deſigns, to be any thing but what they are.</p>

                  <head>The Affairs of <hi>Italy.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>AT length the Cardinal found by experience, that theſe fetches of the Prince of <hi>Piedmont,</hi> did end in nothing but the retarding the Army, which till then he had paſs'd by, and put up, that it might be known to all Chriſtendome, that the Spaniard and the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> were the hinderers of the Peaces concluſion, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo that he might revictual <hi>Cazal;</hi> but being now ſatisfied, that he could not longer endure it, but with much diſhonour, and the loſſe of his Army, he reſolved to give an end to this affair; to which effect he called for the Marſhals of <hi>Crequy</hi> and <hi>Schom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg,</hi> the <hi>Sieurs d' Auriac, de Thoiras, de Fenquires de Servient,</hi> and <hi>d' Eſmery,</hi> and having made them a relation of all which had paſs'd till that time, both concerning the General, and particular Peace, he deſired their advices, what was proper to be done in that juncture of time. The Queſtion being the keeping of <hi>Cazal</hi> from the Enemy, it was their joynt reſolution that it was abſolutely neceſſary to make ſure of a Paſſage both for their inlet into <hi>Italy,</hi> and for their retreat back again, as occaſion ſhould ſerve. Withal, that to paſſe thither was not ſo difficult, they being ſtrong enough to force their way, in deſpight of any oppoſition, but how to make ſure of a way to convey recruits, of men, mony, victuals, and other neceſſaries, for the refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Army, and to aſſure themſelves of a ſafe regreſſe, in caſe the Army ſhould be worſted, this was the main debates. That to truſt in any promiſes of the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> was abſurd, after he had ſo often played faſt and looſe, and after he had falſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied his word, to their great damage already; The reſult of all at laſt came to this, that they were to make themſelves Maſters of the field, and neither to leave an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my or a Place behind them, which ſhould be able to annoy or offend them in the leaſt; that truth and ſincerity being like the ſoul, once out of the body, it never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns but by miracle, ſo there was no colour of reaſon to hope it might find any place in the Duke of <hi>Savoy's</hi> breſt; that if they ſhould have left his Army behind them, he might with eaſe ſtop up the Paſſages, againſt any recruits whatever, as he had already ſeiſed on the Bridges of <hi>Alpignan</hi> and <hi>Colligny,</hi> and on all the Keys upon the <hi>Doria;</hi> and that there was ſo much the more reaſon to defie him, becauſe he did openly ſide with the Spaniards; That they were no longer to defer the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring of the War againſt him, for that the Army did already begin to be infected with ſickneſſes, and many Troups were forced to disband; as alſo that they had no reaſon to defer the puniſhing of the injuries and indignities offered to the King, in ſo often breaking his word, and cauſing the Army to ſuffer ſo many hardſhips and neceſſities, that he had thereby almoſt indangered the utter loſſe, and ruin of them all.</p>
                  <p>That the Laws of Prudence and Policy aſſure us, that a Prince may juſtly raiſe a War, if any injury which he hath received, make him take up Arms; or if any juſt
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:56802:170"/>fear of imminent danger threaten him or his Armies; he is obliged to provide againſt the worſt, though he be not as yet openly aſſaulted. Now all theſe reaſons were ſo ſtrong on their parts, that they could admit of no reply. It was then unanimouſly concluded on, to aſſault the Duke of <hi>Savoy;</hi> Every thing was diſpoſed and prepared towards the War. However that all the blame and fault might light on the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> the Cardinal ſent both once and again to him, to ſummon him to joyne his Army with the Kings, and to keep thoſe promiſes which he had made to the King at <hi>Suze,</hi> intending by this to take away all juſt occaſions of complaint from his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, Cauſe and Army.</p>

                  <p>HOw Eminent or great ſoever the diſcretion and Judgment of a Commander is, yet he ought to take advice and Counſel in ſuch occaſions.

It is to be doubted, that thoſe reſolutions which are not well anvil'd and canvaſſed by deliberation, will be thwarted by ſome mis-fortune in their Execution, when as a ſound diſcuſſing of them, many times ſecures them from any attempt that Fortune can make upon them. It ſufficeth not to have taken good advice in the beginning, becauſe commonly none is ſo bad as that which never changeth: So that a man cannot be too long in deliberating the doing of a thing, which he would fain bring to paſſe, provided he do not let ſlip the opportunity of putting it in Execution.</p>

                  <p>BEfore I proceed any farther, I am obliged to appeal unto all men, even thoſe who have the leaſt ſparks of Juſtice is them, to condemn that envious Quill which makes open profeſſion, and endeavours with Calumnie to ſully, if it were poſſible, the Glory and Splendor of the Cardinal, whilſt truth doth not furniſh him with any one ſubject of that nature to work upon. It is ſaid by him; the Calumniator I mean, that the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> had never with drawn himſelf from the Kings Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts, had not the Cardinal (being mis-informed of his Perſon and proceedings) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed, and in effect forced him to caſt himſelf upon the Spaniſh party, much contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to his own will and inclination. But what? Was the continual and daily ſending to him Perſons of the beſt ranck and quality of the Army, with all imaginable proffers of Peace, a deſpiſing of him? Were thoſe many Conferences with the Prince of <hi>Piedmont,</hi> and thoſe extraordinary Civilities done to him, which would have wrought upon the moſt ſavage diſpoſition, a deſpiſing of him? Was the Paſſing by of a thouſand tricks and delayes for a whole Months time, in which the whole Army had like to have been ruined by him, and yet not to fall out with him, a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſing of him? Was the ſending of the <hi>Siour de Servient,</hi> the very day before the abſolute breach, to deſire him with all earneſtneſs not to ingage his Majeſties Arms in this extremity, only for having once refuſed to ſee him, a deſpiſing of him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Was the delivery of ſo great a quantity of wheat at <hi>Nice,</hi> and the Permiſſion of carrying as much as he pleaſed out of <hi>Breſſe, Burgogn</hi> and <hi>Dauphine:</hi> a deſpiſing or deceiving him?

                  <p>MAlice is like a Serpent, which turns the faireſt Flowers into the uglieſt Poyſons, and verifies the truth of that antient ſaying; Honor is the Mother of Calumnie. There are no actions how juſt and honourable ſoever, which it will not attempt to beſpatter with ſome baſe unworthy mis-repreſentation. No Innocence can be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure from it's Violences; It cannot more aptly be compared, then to thoſe looking glaſſes which never repreſent the true Ideas of the face: It maketh molehils appear mountains; It fretteth and vexeth at vertue it ſelf, and will raiſe its Batteries to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moliſh it, and though it come to be convinced of their Innocencie whom it perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, yet it thinketh willfulneſſe and obſtinacy in its wickedneſſe, to be more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable then vertuous repentance. The Phyloſophers have given a good Character of it, when they liken it to a black and thick cloud, which hinders and obſcures the light and exerciſes of Reaſon. Hence it comes to paſſe, that as all Bodies repreſent themſelves to our ſight for others, and quite contrary peradventure to what they are, if look't upon through clouds and in diſorders, ſo the moſt commendable and worthieſt Actions will appear and paſſe for low and unmanly, if conſidered through the Perſpectives of Malice and hatred, and revera it makes lyes and Impoſtures paſſe for Realities and Currant truths. High and generous Souls are unconcerned at the backbitings of Envie, and do not ceaſe to continue vertuous, notwithſtanding all her detractions. They know, that not only Malice but Envy too hath alwayes endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to defame the greateſt Perſonages, and ableſt Miniſters of State, and that good men cannot believe any of their falſe Commentaries, without doing an injury to themſelves, that this Monſter is eaſileſt overcome by ſcorn; And that the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity of their undertaking is their Bulwark, and like the Sun diſſipateth and diſpelleth all thoſe clouds and ſtorms which would obfuſcate and diminiſh their Splendour, and in fine maketh them Triumph and Glory over the Malice of their Enemies.</p>

An Act very ſtrange, againſt both the Laws of Traffique and Piety. The Cardinal he did the ſame<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſeeing it was no time to hope for any thing by fair means.

Many offered to his Majeſties conſideration, that the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> and Marques <hi>Spinola,</hi> would never hearken to any Peace, but by neceſſity, and to regain <hi>Pignerol,</hi> having until that time refuſed to do it, but upon diſhonorable terms for his Majeſty; That there was little reaſon to truſt him; as to that of the Duke of <hi>Mantua,</hi> for whoſe ſake the War was begun, or to believe that the Peace might be of ſome continuance. And on the contrary; there were good grounds to apprehend, that they would not conclude a Peace, in that weak condition, to which they were then reduced, but onely that they might bring to paſſe their Intentions upon the Duke of <hi>Mantua,</hi> ſo that the King ſhould ſtill keep <hi>Pignerol,</hi> which would give him a free entrance into <hi>Italy,</hi> that his Majeſty might with more eaſe take in <hi>Montferrat,</hi> as occaſion ſhould ſerve. That Princes not having any Juſter titles to thoſe places, which they poſſeſs, then the conqueſt of them in a juſt War, his Majeſty ſhould not acquit that which makes him ſo conſiderable in and to <hi>Italy,</hi> being by it able to march into it, when and as often as he pleaſed, and to ſet bounds to the Spaniſh Ambition, who would find work enough to do, ſo long as his Majeſty continued Maſter of it; that it would ſerve to Curb the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> who did nothing but commence and create every year new broyles and troubles. In fine that it was abſolutely need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to enter upon <hi>Savoy,</hi> becauſe the Duke would infallibly beſiege thoſe places which had been taken, if his Army were not other wayes diverted; and in caſe he ſhould not beſiege them, his forces would be coaſting of it from one end to t'other of <hi>Savoy,</hi> and indanger the Paſſages, at leaſt diſturb them, which were of neceſſity to be preſerved; for that <hi>Spinola</hi> had riſen to beſiege <hi>Cazal,</hi> at the ſame time that the Cardinal marched towards <hi>Grenoble.</hi> Could there be more juſt or important conſiderations? did they not deſerve to be regarded and lookt after? Could any one with reaſon ſay that the Peace was in the Cardinals power, when the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> would not conclude it, without the ſurrender of <hi>Pignerol?</hi> the Importance of which Place was ſo great as ſhall be anon diſcourſed more at large. Indeed ſuch things might take with Women (whom the noiſe of a Cannon terrifies) to juduce them to deliver up a place of ſuch concernment into the hands of the Spaniards and Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> who had made it evident, no truſt could be repoſed in him.

                  <p>A Little while after his Majeſties arrival at <hi>St, John de Morienne,</hi> he was ſeized on by 2 or 3 fits of a Fever, which gave occaſion to the Cardinal to doubt, leſt his Majeſty might fall into ſome more dangerous ſickneſſe. And as one never ought to hazard the Perſon of a King, who is the Soul of his State; the heart which diſtributeth the Spirits of life by the Arteries unto all parts; the Liver which giveth nouriſhment to all, and the principal of all others good fortune, ſo the Cardinal en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated his Majeſty, with ſo many inſtances to retire himſelf from that abode (which was neer hand infected all over with the peſtilence) and return to <hi>Lyon,</hi> where he would find a good ayr, and eaſe from thoſe great Cares, which the War had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged him, to take upon himſelf: that at laſt he did accordingly reſolve to return, and arrived there about the beginning of <hi>Auguſt.</hi> The Cardinal in the mean time could not think of quitting the Army ſo ſoon, foreſeeing that ſhould he have gone with his Majeſty, the Enemy would have taken a great advantage of it, and that alſo the Souldiers, (of whom a great number had been deſtroyed by the plague) would quickly loſe their Courage, perſwading themſelves, that <hi>Montferrat</hi> would be abandoned after his departure. He was ſufficiently informed that the Lord keeper <hi>Marillac,</hi> had ſuch an influence upon the Queen Mothers ſoul, that he had perver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that affection wherewith ſhe had other times honoured him, into a mortal ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, and that this old imbroyler, whom the Combination had heretofore taught, to extract of Quinteſſence from the very Spirits, had no other deſign, then to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy all his power, which ſuch a Mother might have over ſo good a Son, as the King was, for to ruin him in the honour of his good opinion and favour, and to raiſe himſelf if it were poſſible upon this ruin of his Fortunes, even to the highſt degree of the Adminiſtration. However he had teſtimonies too infallible of the Kings bounty, which he could not diſtruſt, for that his Majeſty was better informed of his faithfulneſs, then any other perſon whatſoever.

                  <p>THE greateſt teſtimony of fidelity which Miniſter can give, is to renounce his own Intereſts, for the glory of his Maſter. One cannot doubt but that he was obliged to hazard his Fortunes for his ſervice, ſeeing that he gave it him, but not his blond and life too. However as there are no ſtronger or more natural in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations, then thoſe which carry a man to love that which concerneth him, ſo he could not give more certain proofs of the true paſſion which he had for his Prince, the to prefer the Glory of his Crown, of his Power, before all the advantages which he hath received from Fortune. But as this is the beſt Touch-ſtone by which one can judge of the ſincerity of his Affections; ſo one is obliged to eſteem him ſo much the more after the ſhewing of ſuch a proof: for this true affection is a rare thing in the Courts of Kings. Every one ſacrificeth to his own Intereſts: Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is honoured with ſo much eſteem, that no one but ſtoops to it, and abando<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth all things to attain it. Whatever obligation there is to love Kings, yet they are the men, who have the feweſt true friends, and if their ſervice bring the leaſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice to any man's Fortunes, they will ſoon find themſelves deſerted. They are ordinarily loved as the Sun, with which one is glad to be enlightned, ſo long as his

                  <p>AT laſt the courage and fidelity of the Cardinal could no longer oppoſe the violence of the Plague and other diſeaſes, which had conſumed two thirds of the Souldiers: So it was the more needful to raiſe new forces or rather to form the body of a new Army; for that <hi>Cazal</hi> began to be cloſe preſt upon by the Spaniard. The Cardinal found his preſence was very neceſſary in <hi>France,</hi> to diſpatch ſuch forces over the Hils, and to take order for the ſending of monies, and victuals, both which were for the moſt part raiſed by his credit; All which began to be ſcarce by the unworthy Artifices of the Lord Treaſurer &amp; his Brother, and thoſe of his Cabal. He found himſelf obliged to return, to the King at <hi>Lyon.</hi> Where it was a very great
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:56802:179"/>ſatisfaction to him, to find his Majeſty in ſy good health, after the apprehenſions which he had, leſt thoſe fits of a Feaver might have ended in ſome more dangerous ſickneſs; but one cannot imagine how ſenſibly he was troubled, to find the Queen Mothers Spirit ſo extreamly exaſperated againſt him, though the King indeed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook his protection upon all occaſions. He believed that the Lord Keeper who had raviſhed from him the good will of his Miſtreſs, was able to re-eſtate him in it again, and though it be very difficult to pay honour and reſpect to a perſon, who can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be called other then a Monſter of Ingratitude, yet he went ſeveral times to wayt upon him, and endeavoured by all ſorts of kindneſſes and good Offices, to draw him to acknowledge the ſervice which he owed, and the great obligations which were due to him. Now although Honor and good Actions break even rocks, and are the moſt powerful means which a man can imploy to move the mind, yet Ambition, which had taken up the poſſeſſion of this turbulent man, ſo hindered him, that he could not addreſſe himſelf to any thing, but a conſtrain'd diſſimulation, which under the appearance of a counterfeited compliance, concealed that fire, which could never be extinguiſhed after the Combination, and which then conſumed him in ſo blind a paſſion, that he preferred the Intereſts of <hi>Spain</hi> before thoſe of his own Country, and did a thouſand things unworthy of his quality. The Honor and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours which the Cardinal did him, could not, as I ſaid, quench that ſeditious fire, which inſteed of being put out, lay raked up under the Cinders of a diſſembled and counterfeited Soul. Inſomuch that the Soul of this make-bate, could not reſt, but continued and kept up thoſe Cabals neer the Queen Mother, not only blowing up her paſſion that it might not entinguiſh, but ſometimes caſting Oile upon it, but with ſuch dexterouſneſſe, that there were not any, but ſuch as were very neer this great Princeſſe, which could ever perceive it.</p>

It was not long before theſe two Armies met at <hi>Villebone,</hi> but the <hi>Venetians</hi> not being diſciplined to War, gave ground, ſo that only the French, the Corſes and Capelets continued the fight, their courage carrying them on, to reſolve to periſh in that incounter, in which the ſmalneſſe of the number, to which they were reduced, did not give them any hopes of overcoming; only they would not looſe their reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by a ſhameful flight; ſo the moſt part were taken, kild, or wounded, ſo much did the heat of their courages ingage them: They had doubtleſſe had a happier ſucceſs, had they been ſeconded by the <hi>Venetians</hi> though never ſo few; who not being accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed to fight, were dazled with the brightneſs of the Arms, and affrighted with the noiſe of the muſquet ſhot.</p>

                  <p>THere is nothing more dangerous to a State, then the want of well diſciplined Troops: War is an Art to be learn't, as other Arts are, and they whoſe cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages are not fixed by experience, are commonly ſeized upon by ſome fears in their firſt encounters. The Romans quickly found their Empire, rent and devided be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween their Enemies, after their Peace had diſaccuſtomed their Souldiers from flights. Their wiſeſt Politicians thought themſelves very unfortunate, when they had no more Enemies to keep their Troops in Breath, and looked upon the taking of <hi>Carthage,</hi> (which from time to time kept them in Action) as a greater mis-fortune to them, then the loſſe of ſome great Country. That which renders <hi>France</hi> ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doutable, is the happineſſe it hath, in the Cardinals being Chief Miniſter of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties will and pleaſure, whoſe Arme is ſtil provided, and ſtore of Troops abroad, who want not any manner of imployment. That which gives ſo great a facility to the invation of <hi>Italy,</hi> is their want of diſciplined Troops; for thoſe which it fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſheth to the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> do moſt of them periſh in forraign Countries. I cannot but much wonder, that <hi>Machiavile,</hi> did ſo much forget himſelf, in this point of Prudence, as to aver, That it was dangerous to accuſtome a people to War: For though their courages be prejudicial in civil Wars, yet they are neceſſary to oppoſe themſelves, againſt the incurſion of Forrainers. And a Sage Politician, that he might avoid the inconveniences of civil Wars, followed this example, which the Cardinal hath given to all Princes, and which preſerved <hi>France,</hi> in the happineſs, of a long Peace, by keeping Troops ſtill on foot, who were ſtill ready to ſuppreſſe any inſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections which might ariſe, and not ſuffering them, to be vanting in other Countries and amongſt our Neighbours.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>THE loſſe of <hi>Mantua,</hi> is principaly attributed to three cauſes. The firſt was <hi>Guastale,</hi> who gave Intelligence to the Imperialiſts, from within ſo that they were not only well informed, of that <hi>Avenue</hi> which was inacceſſible to men, who were not acquainted with the condition and quality of the place, and what courſes they ought to take to arrive there, by the-Inhabitants themſelves, but were alſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conded by ſome of the Inhabitants, after they were once entred. The Venetians bore another part of the Blame, by reaſon of the long delayes which they uſed in revictualling of <hi>Mantua,</hi> for the laſt convoy which they ſent, could not enter, the Imperialiſts having ſtop't up the <hi>Avenues;</hi> as alſo for that they defferred the raiſing of their Troups, it being certain, that had they made their levies and advanced at the beginning of the year, they might have taken all Imperial Gariſons and cut them in pieces, whereas they ſtayed until the new German Army came, and their Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers being al unskilful and not trained up the Wars, it was not difficult for the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perialiſts to defeat them, to make themſelves Maſters of the field, and to take in all the little holds thereabouts. The Duke of <hi>Mantua</hi> is ſomewhat blamed too, for not being careful enough, to reinforce his Garriſon with freſh ſupplies, at the ſame times that the ſickneſs decreaſed them, whatever inſtances the Marſhal <hi>d' Eſtree</hi> uſed to him from the King to that effect. The neglect whereof, was the cauſe, that the Enemies found not men enough in the Town, to oppoſe their fury or beat them off; which doubtleſſe might have been done, had there been barely a thouſand men in it.</p>

<pb n="351" facs="tcp:56802:180"/>enjoyment of it; To do ſo, were to leave fire amongſt ſtraw, which wil ſoon raiſe great flames, and he may be very ſure, his Country will not long continue without trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles.

Thoſe of the Town could not imagine the Kings Army to be ſo neer, ſo that they deſired leave to ſend their Deputies to treat with the Generals, which was granted to them, and accordingly they were conducted where they then were: But upon their return, 500 choiſe men were clap't into it, diſcharging both at them and ours too, with ſuch inſolence, that the Generals being informed of it, advanced with the Army. Many who made the firſt approches, were ſlain and wounded: But the courages of others, who ſaw them in his condition, could not endure to ſuffer the Kings Army to receive ſuch an affront, without a ready help and aſſiſtance; ſo they uſed ſuch dilligence in planting the Cannon, that they were mounted within twenty paces of the Walls, and ready to make a breach, within two or three hours, after their arrival. Whence it happened, that the Inhabitants, being aſtoniſhed, preſently rendered themſelves, and the Caſtle had not the hardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to hold out above 24 hours, though there were 500 men in it, whom they would not receive but in the quality of Priſoners of War, to qualifie by their fear, the heat of the raſhneſs which they had uſed.

However this did but excite the ſpirit and courage of the French, whoſe impatience was ſuch, that it would have carried them on to the relief of <hi>Cazal</hi> by plain force. A propoſition of ſo extraordinary a conſequence could not ſuddenly be reſolved on; but a Ceſſation of Arms for three daies was concluded, and that ſeconded for three daies more.

                  <p>A Treaty is the ordinary beginning of Peace, whoever begins to treat on condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to ſurceaſe for ſome time all Acts of Hoſtility, hath a great inclination to make an agreement. The onely indeavouring of a Treaty doth ordinarily teſtifie, that the fire which inflamed the War is now extinguiſhing, and the pleaſantneſſe which is found in a Truce, is a certain Charm, which doth inſenſibly allure one to a final accommodation, as <hi>Plutarch</hi> hath demonſtrated in the life of <hi>Nicias,</hi> ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the Truce which was made between the Athenians and the Lacedemonians; ſo that he who would make a good accommodation, conſidering the incertain ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe of War, ought never to refuſe a Treaty, provided it be upon honourable terms. So much the rather ought he ſo to do, for that thoſe very actions by which he propoſeth to obtain a Victory, may end in a ſhamefull flight; in Treaties one ought not alwaies to look forſuch advantagious conditions; but each ſide muſt yeeld and give away a little of that which is their own. Thus did <hi>Pericles</hi> (one of the wifeſt: Miniſters of State amongſt the Ancients) make no difficulty, to grant the Treaty which was made between the Athenians, and thoſe of <hi>Sparta,</hi> that the Athenians ſhould every yeer ſend them two Talents, though they did in ſome ſort pay dear enough for them, as <hi>Plutarch</hi> obſerves in the life of <hi>Pericles.</hi> So <hi>Lewis</hi> the Eleventh, whoſe Prudence is much commended in our Hiſtories, eaſily accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the Treaty made with <hi>Edward</hi> King of <hi>England</hi> for nine years, paying him yearly 50000 Duckets of Gold, which the Engliſh vainly called Tribute; but were in effect a Penſion, and was accordingly ſo termed by the French. It is true it cannot be paid with any great deal of honour; but it was however commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble by the Laws of Prudent Policy, becauſe ſent the Engliſh out of <hi>France,</hi> who had they joined their Forces with <hi>Charles</hi> of <hi>Bourgogne,</hi> might have much indange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red it.

                  <p>THis Truce was much condemned by many, and by the Cardinal himſelf too, who was juſt upon the point of perſwading his Majeſty to make a Declaration, by
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:56802:184"/>which he ſhould diſ-own thoſe who had ſigned it, and with expreſſe command to his Army to advance: The Gallantry of his Courage, which knoweth not what it is to give ground, could not endure that the Town and Caſtle of <hi>Cazal</hi> ſhould be delivered up into <hi>Spinola</hi>'s hands; and it is not to be doubted, that had his Majeſty been there, it had never been aſſented to at all. But however, take the reaſons upon which it was ſo reſolved, which I do the more willingly ſet down, to excuſe thoſe who undertook it: The firſt and principle was, the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> was much inclined and promiſed, to join himſelf with the Kings Army, if the Spaniards did not agree to thoſe conditions which had formerly been aſcertain'd with <hi>Spinola. Mazarini</hi> paſſed his word, that the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> ſhould write a Letter about it to the Dutcheſſe of <hi>Savoy;</hi> of which the Generals of the Army ſhould have a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py for their diſcharge; ſo that agreeing in this manner with the Duke of <hi>Savoy;</hi> the Spaniards were obliged to conclude the Peace; and if not the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> was ingaged to joyn his with the Kings Forces, to relieve <hi>Cazal.</hi> There was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to fear in reſpect of <hi>Cazal,</hi> but on the contrary, the delivery of it was cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain; and moſt true it is, without that the Generals had never reſolved upon that particular. And the extream neceſſities, to which <hi>Cazal</hi> was reduced, as <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur de Thoyras</hi> ſent word, cauſed them to doubt, leſt that in few dayes (and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Army could come up) the inhabitants who were wearied out, with ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of inconveniences for three years together, ſome of them who were gained by the Spaniſh party, ſhould force the Garriſon to ſurrender, which could not be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered without great diſhonour to the Kings Army. Beſides the Marqueſſe <hi>de Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ze,</hi> had order from the Generals to go to <hi>Cazal,</hi> under pretence of finiſhing the Treaty however, not to execute it, untill he had conferred with the <hi>Sieur de Thoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras,</hi> and underſtood whether or no he could hold out, till the relief came, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out danger, and then to aſſure him, that in caſe he could, the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>To be ſhort, it was thought neceſſary to refreſh the Army, and to give them more ſcope, they being much afflicted with the ſickneſſe, and to releive <hi>Cazal,</hi> they were of neceſſity to march 30 leagues through an Enemies Country, with a ſmall proportion of victuals, and without any retreating place at all.</p>

                  <p>A Man may ſay thus much in the behalf of thoſe, who were Authors of this Truce, that whoever pretends to make a long and durable Peace, ought not to refuſe ſome ſatisfaction to his enemies; who in caſe they be forced to conclude with diſhonour and confuſion preſently break out again, as ſoon as they find them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in a Condition of taking their revenge. Such was the opinion of <hi>Archida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi> when he would have perſwaded the Lacedemonians, to make a Peace with the Thebans, upon the relation of <hi>Iſocrates.</hi> And indeed it is impoſſible to make a good and firm eſtabliſhment of a Peace, if one ſide hath all the advantages, and t'other be driven into deſperation. And as nothing doth ſo much excite courage, as the loſſe of honour, ſo it ingageth them to new attempts, without any hopes of reducing them to a ſecond Peace. If one hath not Forces infinitely above theirs, and be not abſolutely aſſured of the victory. Neceſſity it ſelf when a man find that he ſuffers with ſhame and diſcredit, makes one of them worth four; and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth him who before fled, to face about with fury. It ſnatcheth away all fears, and there is not any thing which it doth not perſwade and lead him to. The Events of War are incertain, and it is in fights, as in other affairs of the World; ſometimes he who negotiateth findeth himſelf reduced in certain conjunctures, to put himſelf upon an eminent hazard of loſing all, to gain all the advantage to himſelf; ſo he who in a combat would carry away all the glory by a high hand, doth often ſee it reaped by his enemies, for that he attempted to reduce them to too great an extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity.</p>

                  <p>DUring the Treaty, God Almighty (who hath not made Princes of any other temper, then other men) permitted the King to fall into a violent diſeaſe, the iſſue whereof being incertain, put the affairs of the Kingdom into a ſtrange con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion. But as all the ſickneſſes wherewith he doth afflict men, are not to deſtroy them, (his love alwaies guiding and conducting the order of humane affairs) ſo he would not deprive <hi>France</hi> of a King, who was ſo neceſſary for them, nor the Church of her eldeſt ſon, who fought for her Liberty. He reſtored him his health, and imployed the ſickneſs, to let him know, that he was liable to the Laws of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane frailty, as well as the leaſt of his ſubjects. He gave him this occaſion to make known that vertue and extraordinary Piety, wherewith he had inveſted his Soul. His Courage evidenced to all the World that he did not fear death, but conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it as an eaſie paſſage from the miſeries of this life, to the eternal happineſſes of Heaven; his thoughts were not fix'd upon any thing, but how to render his Soul worthy of the divine mercy which he did hope to obtain. The onely regret which he teſtified, was, not the leaving his Crown, but the having com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted offences, which humane weakneſſe cannot avoid, and for which he deſired pardon of God, which (all bathed in his tears) he begged thoſe who were preſent to aſſiſt him in.</p>

                  <p>KIngs are not exempted by the luſtre of their Crowns from the neceſſities either of ſickneſſe or death. If their Birth and Scepter have advanced them, ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and death render them equal. The greateſt part of adverſities do not ſpare them at all during their lives. But it ſhould rather ſeem on the contrary, that the greatneſſe of their birth, hath obliged them to undergo the greater afflictions: The divine Prudence having ſo ordain'd it, to let them know they are but men. The valiant <hi>Alexander</hi> bewitched with his Conqueſts, ſuffered himſelf to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded by his flatterers, that he was of the Race of the Gods; and he was not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceiv'd of this preſumptuous opinion untill he was wounded, and ſaw the blood run down from his wound. There is indeed nothing more ordinary with great men then to forget themſelves amidſt thoſe extraordinary reſpects which are payd to them. God hath left them ſubject to the ſame afflictions with the reſt of men, which ſerve as ſo many calls to advertiſe them, that their Felicity is not on earth, and that their Kingdom is but a place of exile, where God hath left them liable to the ſame inconveniences. That true greatneſs doth not ſo much conſiſt in the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to do whatſoever one would, as in the will to do what one ought. That it is blindneſs to meaſure their power by the licentiouſneſs of ſatisfying their Paſſions, and that the greateſt Princes in ſubjecting all things, have firſt ſubjected themſelves to reaſon; ſhewing in all their actions, that though they could do any thing, yet they would attempt nothing, but what were fit and worthy of Gods Lieutenant; that greatneſſe doth not acquit them from well-doing; but on the contrary, as it hath furniſhed them with more opportunities, ſo more is expected from them; that their ſureſt Revenue is the good and love of their people, and that they ought not ſo much to fear to ſuffer evil, as to do evil.</p>

                  <p>THe Kings ſickneſſe produced ſeveral occaſions, by which the Cardinal per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, but with great grief, the extremity of the hatred which the Queen Mother had conceived againſt him, which made him redouble his care, to do all things which might render him agreeable to his ſpirit. There was no one quality or thing able to beget good will in the hearts of men, with which he did not ſtudy
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:56802:185"/>to furniſh himſelf, that he might render himſelf deſerving of the honour of his Majeſties good favour. Good Offices make a man acceptable, and it cannot be related with how much Paſſion he imbraced his Majeſties Intereſts. We uſually love them, that love our relations, and the Cardinal had ſo great a deſire to plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure his Majeſty, that forgetting all the injuries which he had received from the Marſhal <hi>de Marillac,</hi> he got ten thouſand Crowns to be preſented to him, and a Command given him, equal with that of the Marſhals of <hi>Force</hi> and <hi>Schomberg,</hi> to go to the relief of <hi>Cazal.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is impoſſible to hinder our wills from loving them who love us, it being very true, that there is no ſtronger charm to oblige others to love us, then our firſt loving them. Now there is not any perſon can better teſtifie (them the Queen Mother her ſelf, and thoſe who were neer her, both at <hi>Lyon</hi> and in her return to <hi>Paris</hi>) how much zeal and affection the Cardinal vowed, proteſted and ſhewed to her in a thouſand actions which concern'd her ſervice. Great ſubmiſſions reclaim the moſt brutiſh natures. Now nothing could be added to thoſe which the Cardinal made to his Majeſty at <hi>Lyon,</hi> and in the ſame journey to <hi>Paris,</hi> when he begged his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don in behalf of his moſt juſt intentions, as if they had been moſt grievous offences; and in ſuch a manner as was able to allay the fury of a Lyon. Was it needfull to imploy ſo many cares, to uſe ſo much induſtry, to make him be beloved who was the chiefeſt of men, and the moſt amiable? Thoſe eminent qualities wherewith the Creator of the Univerſe hath inriched him, as a Maſter-piece of his Power, and which he form'd but once in ſix ages, and ſo many glorious exploits, which have immortalized his honour, are not theſe I ſay ſuch efficacious charms, that it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to ſee him and not to love him? It is true, that they were ſufficient to have wrought upon any ſpirit, which had not been cemented in its Paſſion for above two vears together. And though it were ſo, he for his part did never forget any of thoſe things which are imagined to be capable of re-eſtating himſelf in her good thoughts. The ordinary diſcourſe with which he entertained her was, that he could never do enough to recover that place (which he had heretofore had the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to poſſeſſe) in her good opinion; and to confeſſe and acknowledge to her, thoſe great favours for which he was ſtill ingaged to her; though indeed, and by the ſtrict Laws of Equity, they were procured and beſtowed upon him, as ſo many juſt recompences of his ſervices, or to ingage him to do others of more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, as the effects of a pure liberallity. But after all, either theſe indeavours, theſe cares, theſe ſervices, theſe reſpects, or theſe ſubmiſſions, could mitigate that ſharpneſſe which had taken poſſeſſion of her ſpirit. They wrought for ſome time ſo much upon her reaſon, that ſhe kept all fair, and ſeemed not to be diſpleaſed, but aſſoon as ſhe was arrived at <hi>Paris,</hi> her Paſſion revived, and to that height, that ſhe removed out of her family, Madam <hi>de Combal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>JT cannot be denied, but that the Cardinal was affected with ſuch apparent grief on this occaſion, as cannot be imagined, and as it is not generoſity but a poor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſpirit, to a ſhew an inſenſibleneſs on ſuch occaſions; ſo in the Cardinals face one might ſee all the lively marks of diſpleaſure. It was not the apprehenſion of loſing his fortune that did touch him, for he had learnt by a long experience, that the greateſt happineſſe of this life is not confined to the greateſt honours, and that thoſe who govern an Eſtate, are like the Celeſtial Bodies, which receive much honour from the earth, but have no reſt at all; ſo that he had moſt readily renounced all, according as he ſupplicated his Majeſty, if his Majeſty would have thought it fit, who too too well knew of what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment he was to his State. It could not be, that he did ſuſpect his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties goodneſſe or conſtancy, to whom hee knew his fidelity, was better known then to all the reſt of <hi>France,</hi> and of whoſe affection he had ſo many dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly teſtimonies, that he could not but without great blame have him in any doubt at all. But as Innocence cannot without trouble paſſe for guilty; ſo the vice of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude with which the Queen Mother did ſtrive to ſully his glory, made it ſo much the more inſupportable, by how much leſſe he had deſerved it. He was not to learn that the power of Grandees was potent enough to inſinuate into the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples minds, their particular thoughts for infallible truths, and that ſhe might in <hi>France,</hi> and to poſterity, make him paſſe for an ungratefull ſervant of thoſe favours which ſhe had conferred upon him. It was for this, that he could not imagine (no more then he Kings loyal ſervants) that (after he had given canſe to the whole World to admire him) the Artifices of ſome ſeditious ſpirits, would be able to counterpoiſe his glory.</p>
                  <p>Ingratitude is a deficiency of that acknowledgement which one ought to have for good Offices, ſo that who ſo confeſſeth himſelf to be indebted, cannot be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed.

And as if the condiſcendence which he ſhould make to the Queen Mothers will, would not be one of the greateſt defects in a perſon of his Truſt! It is true that her birth, might oblige him to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary ſervices, but they never ought to run counter to the fidelity due to his Maſter, which commands him to paſſe by no occaſion of preſerving or augment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his glory.

The firſt is, the effect of a great neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect: The ſecond, may ſometimes proceed from a want of ability. But the third, can proceed from no other cauſe but a black deformed malice. So though the firſt cannot be excuſed, yet it may be born with. The ſecond, was in ſo great deteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by the Egyptians, that they cauſed ſuch as they found culpable, to be proclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by the City-Crier, to the end, that no one might afterwards do them any kindneſs, thinking it very reaſonable that he ſhould loſe all his friends who had not been carefull to retaliate like for like to him who had obliged him.

                  <p>DUring his Majeſties ſickneſſe, and their beginning of theſe Intreagues, the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of <hi>Cazal</hi> were finiſhed upon the Treaty aforeſaid. The Duke of <hi>Savoy, Mazarini</hi> and <hi>Colalte</hi> received news from <hi>Germany,</hi> that the <hi>Sieur de Leon,</hi> who was employed by his Majeſty for a Peace to the Emperour had concluded a Treaty; and ſhourtly after the <hi>Sieur</hi> of <hi>St. Eſtienne</hi> brought it to Generals, with Letters from the <hi>Sieur de Leons,</hi> and an expreſſe promiſe from the Emperour, that he would inſtall the Duke of <hi>Mantua</hi> in his Dutchy and Marquiſate of <hi>Montferrat,</hi> with conſent that the Town, Caſtle, and Cittadel of <hi>Cazal</hi> ſhould be delivered in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his hands.</p>

                  <p>This was as much as could be deſired for the foundation, but the circumſtances how to do it, were difficult, it being agreed by the Treaty, that the Emperour would inveſt the ſaid Duke, only within ſix weeks, and that fifteen daies, after he would withdraw his Arms out of <hi>Mantua,</hi> and the King of <hi>Spain</hi> his from <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zal,</hi> and other places of <hi>Montferrat.</hi> This did much trouble the Generals, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this Article did much oblige them to remain in <hi>Italy</hi> two moneths longer with the Army, before the Spaniards would leave <hi>Cazal;</hi> which ſtay they could hardly make, becauſe the Plague was very rife in the Army, and they had victuals but for certain days; theſe two reaſons would infallibly force them to break up, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore half the time were elapſed: which ſhould they have done, the Spaniards might with eaſe become Maſters of <hi>Cazal,</hi> who had not ſubſcribed to it, with their uſual deſigns, becauſe they had liberty to hold the advantage they had got, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the Treaty ſhould be brought. Theſe juſt conſiderations were debated by the Generals, who believed his Majeſty would never ratifie it, ſo they reſolved not to regard it, but to march with the Army with all ſpeed before <hi>Cazal.</hi> The Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards being inform'd of this reſolution were ſo much ſurprized by their apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the firſt ſtock of the French, who at the firſt onſet, fight like Lyons. They preſently ſent back <hi>Mazarini,</hi> who had brought them the news, to aſſure them that they would obſerve the Treaty of Peace, and that to put it in execution, they were content to permit the importation of a whole years prouiſions into the Citta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del of <hi>Cazal.</hi> But the Generals having once heard that they began to be in fear, concluded, eſpecially the Marſhal of <hi>Schomberg,</hi> that they ſhould preſently advance to <hi>Cazal,</hi> thinking that their appearance only, would force the Spaniards to quit the Siege forthwith, without ſtaying till the end of the two moneths, which was accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Treaty.</p>

                  <p>IT is very difficult to Treat a Peace, which may have an aſſured end, in a place far diſtant from Armies, whileſt they are enemies.

It is with thoſe who tranſact affairs at a great diſtance, as with Aſtrologers, who do contemplate here below the Stars of Heaven, perceiving only that which is moſt apparent in them, without being able to obſerve many particular Qualities. So thoſe ſee nothing but the Lump of buſineſſe, and are moſt commonly to ſeek in the particular and preſent diſpoſition of affairs, without the exact knowledge of all which, nothing can be certainly reſolved on, which ſhall ſurely be put in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution.

The only ſhewing of a good mind to be in Action, and putting an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my into Battalia, doth ſtrike fear into an Enemy: He ought in a long Treaty to ſhew that his Courage maketh him deſpiſe any danger; and as he propoſeth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but to vanquiſh, ſo he feareth nothing but not to overcome. He ought not to have any apprehenſions of the Inconſtancies of Fortune, but to hope, that his Courage may enforce her to be favourable.

However the Cardinal offered one thing to his Majeſties conſideration, that it would be needfull to take care for the maintaining of Religion, in preſerving of States, and to ingage the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> not to commit outrages againſt it, where he found it ſetled. His Majeſty took time to deliberate and reſolve on the Articles of their Treaty, which being concluded and aſſigned about the beginning of the yeer following, I ſhal then re-aſſume my diſcourſe of it, in its due order.</p>

                  <p>HAſty raſhneſſe in reſolving upon grant affairs, is as dangerous, as a nimble executing of them is advantagious; Prudence ought to guide both one and t'other. And whatever Juſtice appear above-board in deſigns, yet they are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to have but ill ſucceſſes, if not commenced with mature deliberation. Though the wiſe man reſolve to do ſuch a thing which he knows to be juſt, yet he will take time to deliberate on the means. And as the intereſt of Religion is very conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, ſo the Cardinal would not act any thing untill that were ſecured: Whereas on the contrary, raſh, haſty perſons, do greedily run unto the end which they have once concluded; but never examine the ways which conduce to attain to it; thus they do many times find themſelves ſo at a loſſe, and intangled in the executing their deſigns, that they at laſt find no dore to walk out at with honour, and ſo leave off with ſhame and confuſion.

                  <p>THe King who was not to ſeek in any thing which concerned the good of his State, would now make another proof of the knowledge he had of that Prudent maxime. One of the places of Secretary of State, being vacant by the death of the <hi>Sieur de Beauclere,</hi> his Majeſty recollected in his mind, the ſervices of the <hi>Sieur de Servient;</hi> the Prudence wherewith he treated in <hi>Piedmont</hi> and <hi>Savoy;</hi> the fidelity wherewith he had guided himſelf in thoſe Treaties, wherein he had been imployed ſince the beginning of the War. The intelligence of Forraign affairs, which had made him happy and conſiderable in ſeveral encounters. The good or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which he kept in the Army, whileſt he was ſuper-intendent of Juſtice; and the eloquence which he had teſtified in his younger daies, in ſeveral Charges. Now that ſo many good qualities might not be let lie without honour, and ſo many noble actions without reward; his Majeſty as I ſaid, thought fit to impoſe the Charge on him, of having a care concerning the Affairs of War, making it evident by his judicious choice, how exactly well his Prudence knew to make uſe of perſons, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the particular qualifications of their minds.</p>

He ſhould have Experience to manage both at home and abroad, the affairs in which he is imploied.

I know nothing ſo abſurd, as to make a King ſpeak beneath his Majeſty.

                  <p>IT is an act becomming the greatneſs of a Prince, to pardon the faults of Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dees, when there are no longer any apprehenſions of danger to the State, and when they are waſhed out by an humble repentance. The moſt generous are ſtill the moſt mercifull, and they eſteem it as honourable to forget an injury, as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member a kindneſſe. That Emperour was highly commended by all Antiquities, who being to ſign a Warrant of Condemnation, wiſhed he had never learnt to write. And <hi>Solomon</hi> who hath left to all Kings a perfect example of Wiſedome, ſaith it is the glory of a man to paſſe by offences. However a King ought to be mindfull, that he do not too ſoon recall into his Court, a Prince or Grandee, who may be provoked by that Juſtice which hath been paſſed upon him, leaſt the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of revenge which he may meet with in affairs, do carry him inſenſibly to a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapſe. Opportunity is a charm which ingageth men ere they think of it. The leaſt diſguſts which they ſhall receive, will revive their old grudges, and it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for a great perſon to conſerve any Love for a King, from whom he imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth he hath received ſome harſh uſage, and once not loving him, he is above half diſpoſed to raiſe embroils whenever occaſion ſhall ſerve. It is very difficult to join cloſe together that which hath been once broken aſunder, and a reconciliation in point of friendſhip is not ſtronger, then the glue which joyns crackt veſſels, which are eaſily broken aſunder by a ſmall blow.

They who imagine that juſt puniſhments are ſoon for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten, do much deceive themſelves. It is as much as a Stoick would ſay that he had forgot injuries; but Princes are far enough of from ſuch maximes, ſo that the ſafeſt remedy for all their evils, is a removal from the Court, that no meeting with any, who are uſed to ingage people in Intreagues, they will be (as it were) forced to keep within their limits, when as peradventure their paſſions would make them flie out again.</p>

Though the Queen Mother had reaſon to have reſted ſatisfied, knowing her ſelf to be the happieſt, as well as the greateſt Princeſs upon earth, yet ſhe could nor live contented, after the Cabal which had beleagured her Soul, had once perſwaded her, that ſhe was obliged to ruine the Cardinal. She did neer upon the matter equally divide the honour with the King. All the French did indeavour in emulation of one another, to teſtifie by their reſpects and obediences, the ſweetneſſe which did ſhine in all her acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: The Revenues which ſhe injoyed were greater then thoſe of three Queen Dowagers of <hi>France</hi> all together: There was no charge or expence, which ſhe was not able to go through with, witneſſe that magnificent ſtructure of <hi>Luxenbourg,</hi> which contends with the <hi>Louvre,</hi> and is the moſt accompliſhed piece of all that ever any of our Kings have attempted, She could not deny but that ſhe injoyed upon the matter an abſolute Authority in the State. The King permitted her to take up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her ſelf as much as ſhe could wiſh in the adminiſtration of affairs. He reſolved upon no one thing of importance in his Counſel, but upon her advice. When ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity enforced the King from <hi>Paris,</hi> and that ſhe would remain there, he ſtill left the government in her hands, and alſo ordered that Embaſſadours ſhould attend upon her, to communicate forreign affairs to her, and to receive from her mouth reſolutions thereupon. Was not this to poſſeſſe all that is glorious and noble in a Government? Was not this indeed to injoy her ſelf with more pleaſure then the King, ſeeing ſhe was exempted (in what ſhe pleaſed) from thoſe great troubles which accompany the Conduct of Affairs, and from thoſe embroils which are fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent in Wars and Voyages, all which the King was obliged to under-go; but ſhe tied to nothing but what ſhe pleaſed her ſelf, excepting thoſe affairs only, which related to the good of the Kingdom.

Thus the moſt ſublime Acts of the Cardinal, which ſtrook both terrour and admiration into ſtrangers, were no otherwiſe conſidered by her, then as ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny tricks and deceits.

They made her believe that the credit which the King gave to thoſe ſage Counſels of the Cardinal, were an authority ſo great that ſhe was as it were forced to be jealous at it. They excited her upon the ſcore of honour, that ſhe was bound to let all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendom ſee that the power which ſhe had in the State was not ſo ſlight, that her will ſhould become leſſe conſiderable by the oppoſition of a Favourite. Neither did they omit to ſuggeſt to her the re-eſtabliſhment of <hi>Monſieur de Mantua,</hi> as a crime, who was now upon the point of being reſtored to his Eſtates, as if the Intereſts of that Prince ſo important to the Glory of the King and his Crown, ought not to have been preferred before the hatred which ſhe had conceived againſt him.</p>

                  <p>THere is hardly any one thing which they who are neer great Princeſſes, may not in time perſwade them to, when they have once gotten a little credit with them, and that they will but uſe thoſe Artifices to obtain it, which the corruption of the Court ſoon teacheth. The firſt and chief thing they labour, is to inſinuate into their minds, that they are very paſſionately affected for their ſervices and intereſts, and that they have no other deſigns, but what contribute to their glory; this they do, as well knowing affection to be a reaſon able to perſwade Ladies to any thing. Their next care is never to incenſe them either by words or deeds. They flatter all their faults, even to a commendation of them, which makes the word incurable. And though there he noting more free then love and hatred, yet they profeſſe openly they neither love noe hate any but whom they do. They ſerve them with a ſeeming heat and earneſtneſſe upon all occaſions, but are in effect like Curteſans who wiſh to thoſe whom they love, all that is good, excepting Prudence and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Is it not eaſily obſerved, that if any one diſpleaſe them, they are the firſt who ſpeak ill of him? They had much rather deceive them, then hazard their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger by telling truth. And thus by their Compliances and a thouſand ſervices, which are powerfull attracts upon the minds of that Sex, they make themſelves beloved, and acquire a great part of their Truſt and Confidence: This once done, how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny artifices do they then find out to ſurpriſe them? No one can ſo eaſily deceive us, as he who hath once poſſeſſed our minds, with a belief that he loveth us: The bare affection which we repay him, gives him advantage enough in that he is not miſtruſted. The honour which they have to be ordinarily neer her, gives them no little advantage, ſeeing it furniſheth them with opportunities and occaſions of ſaying whatever they have a mind to; they never hazard any thing, for that they have liberty to ſpeak that at another time freely, which peradventure they then cannot without danger. Inſomuch, that if they would make any one be hated, it is a moſt eaſie thing for them to bring it to paſſe. Firſt, they attempt to make them miſtruſted, with great caution, they ſpeak ill of them; but ſo, as it may ſeem to have proceeded from an affection which they have for their ſervice; and this commonly maketh their advices be well received; and having once diſcovered an inclination to receive theſe firſt preparatories, they are not to ſeek in re-criminating them with new charges; and by little and little they inſinuate a belief of their being evil, which renders them hated: And all this, with ſuch a meekneſſe of mind, but ſo full of diſſimulations (of which, the Court is the moſt perfect School) that great Princeſſes can ſo much the leſs eaſily defend themſelves from them; in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard the moſt part of thoſe who come neer them, do hardly ever tell them any truth at all.</p>

                  <p>AS there never yet was any Soul more gratefull or more reſpectfull then the Cardinal, ſo it cannot be expreſſed with what grief he indured the Queen-Mothers anger, and to how many ſubmiſſions he ſtooped, that he might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover her good favour. Shortly after <hi>St. Martins</hi> day, ſhe uſed her very utmoſt
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:56802:194"/>power over the Kings inclinations to deſtroy him, inſomuch that ſhe would not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure to ſee him. But he having reſolved it to be his greateſt Felicity, next that of ſerving his Majeſty, to render all teſtimonies of his fidelity, and of that great Paſſion which he had for her Glory, pretermitted no invention to get the honour of ſeeing her. Sometimes he would addreſſe himſelf to Father <hi>Suffren</hi> the guide of her Conſcience, and beg him with ſigns of extraordinary grief, that he would zealouſly uſe his utmoſt power to procure him that ſatisfaction, and to re-eſtate her mind in her firſt kindneſſes to him, which ſome of her Confidents had now diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. The Good Father did it ſo much the more readily, perceiving that this bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſs of the Queen-Mother, did ſet the whole Court into Factions, that it did di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide the State, raiſed combinations and fomented parties againſt the King himſelf, he repreſented to her, that God commanded her to moderate her hatred, and to behold him with reſpect, who had done ſuch eminent ſervices for the King her ſon but it was to little purpoſe, for he could not at all diſcover any diſpoſition in her, tending to follow his advices. The Cardinal accepted with much affection thoſe offers of the Cardinal <hi>Bagny</hi> his Holineſſes <hi>Nuntio,</hi> a Prelat, not leſſe recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable for the greatneſſe of his Soul, then that of his dignity to attempt and indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour with her upon the ſame ſcore: There could not be any thing added to that great care and prudence which he uſed to allay her Paſſion; at laſt he obtained this advantage, that ſhe condiſcended to ſee him, and to promiſe him ſhe would for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get what was paſt. The meeting was at <hi>Luxenburg</hi> Palace, where the King was preſent: But ſhe diſcovering by her eyes, her words and actions, that there was nothing but apparencies in her reconcilement, he was neceſſitated to make uſe of a more potent cauſe for the obtaining of that, which neither the Piety of Father <hi>Suffren,</hi> nor the Quality or Merit of Cardinal <hi>Bagny</hi> could attain to. The King took the pains upon himſelf, to ſpeak to her once and again with great earneſtneſs, conjuring her to him whom ſhe was equally obliged to as himſelf, to acknowledge him for her moſt faithfull Servitor, and for a Miniſter capable of executing ſeveral great deſigns, of which he had already laid the ground-work. He beſeeched her to re-aſſume her former familiarities with the Cardinals, to aſſiſt at Councels where, of late, ſhe would no more appear, and his Majeſty preſſed her ſo vigorouſly that ſhe could not deny him, which his Majeſty had been ſenſible of two or three ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral times. It is true, ſome have been bold to ſay, that they who nouriſhed her mind with this ſharpneſſe adviſed her to ſtoop in this particular to his Majeſties will, that he might gain a greater power over his Soul, and that ſhe might gain a greater power over his Soul, and the ſhe might find out new occaſions fit to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the Cardinal: But for my own part, I can never believe that her goodneſs could credit them in this point: I ſhall only ſay this much, indeed the Paſſion which ſhe conceived againſt him, was ſo violent, that ſhe could not long forbear, ſo much did his very ſight torment her, and that in effect this meeting was a recommencing of it.</p>

                  <p>THe Marſhal <hi>de Schomberg.</hi> whom ſhe had heretofore much honoured with her Counſels; being return'd from <hi>Piedmont,</hi> imagined that he might perchance work ſomewhat upon her mind; he reſolved accordingly to aſſault her, with all kinds of reaſons, and ſo evidently to demonſtrate to her the wrong ſhe did her ſelf, that he would force her by the conſideration of her own intereſts, to give up her ſelf though ſhe would not do it, either for the Love or Reſpect which ſhe ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the King. He knew belike that intereſt was the breach by which all great Perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nages are taken. He beſeeched her firſt to conſider the great benefits which ſhe received by his Counſels; and that whileſt ſhe had followed them, ſhe was becom the moſt glorious Princeſſe of the World; whereas now ſhe was in a maze, by ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving adhered to the advices of hers and his enemies. It is true, Madam, would he ſometimes ſay, he ever perſwaded you cordially to love the King, to have no other

He entreated her to open her eyes, and to recollect with a difference ſhe found in the effects, and made her apprehend and confeſs, that ſhe could wiſh for nothing which ſhe might not make her ſelf ſure of, if he did but continue in a ſtrict union with his Majeſty and the Cardinal. That if ſhe deſired any authority from the King, he had beſeeched her to aſſiſt in the Councels, only to give her all kind of reſpects and diſtinctions, and had in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner divided his power with her. That if ſhe deſired Gratifications the Cardinal had never been backward to pay them unto her. The great zeal which he had to ſerve her, did even tranſport him to tel her, that her ſeparating her ſelf as ſhe did from the King, would force the King to withdraw himſelf from her; which if it ſhould ſo happen, ſhe would loſe all her power and the people themſelves would no longer pay her their uſual reſpects.</p>
                  <p>Theſe reaſons were ſo potent and conſiderable, that there was nothing could be alledged againſt them and the Queen-Mother had accordingly believed them; but that ſome factious ſpirits about her, perſwaded her that ſhe ſhould add to her au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and greatneſs if ſhe could make herſelf Miſtreſs of this one affair, and thus they eaſily re-inflamed that fire, which the other had taken a great deal of pains to extinguiſh, though in never ſo little a manner. In fine, ſhe became inflexible, and thoſe unworthy miſcreants brought her to that paſſe, that ſhe refuſed his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, when he entreated her to pardon the Cardinal, which ſhe was ſo much the more obliged to have done, he never having really offended her at all.</p>

                  <p>NOthing is more eaſily effected, then to infuſe violences into the minds of great men, when they are once perſwaded it is neceſſary for the preſervation of their Authority. There is not any thing but only power which advanceth them, above other men, and they are eaſily led by it, to ruine every one whom them, conceive to hurt them. But above all, women are moſt ſubject to this fault, in regard they are weaker and more wedded to their Paſſions then men are. The na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural levity of that Sex makes them paſſe with little adoe, from the extremity of love to that of hatred, not being able to keep a <hi>medium:</hi> It is enough to ingage them not to do a thing, if you do but earneſtly entreat them to do it; eſpecially, if they be but a little provoked to anger. Such entreaties as are made to them when ſo affected, cauſe them to paſſe from that of Anger to Fury, and when they cannot diſ-allow of the thing which is entreated of them, yet it is enough to deny it, if they love not the perſon who deſires it. Rigour hath a greater Empire in their Wills then Submiſſion. And they whoſe Souls ſeem to be more heightned then others, are ſo much the more to be feared, they having more mettle then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct; it is impoſſible ever to root out of them any jealouſies which they have once conceived, and their humours are ſo fixed in ſuſpicions that it is almoſt impoſſible to defend ones ſelf from them by lawfull means.

                  <p>IT is very important for a Kings ſervice to make ſure of thoſe in whom the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the blood do moſt confide. It is the only means to keep them within compaſs, and they are only able ſo to diſpoſe them, for that they do make ſuch impreſſions upon their ſpirits as ſhall carry them when and where they pleaſe to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline them. Princes commonly are notwithſtanding the greatneſſe of their Souls, which they receive with their birth, more addicted to their pleaſures then their affairs; whence it happens, that they do not give themſelves time enough to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine of what qualities any things are, or whether fit to be ingaged in or not, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the particular care of that to thoſe whom they confide in, and are contented when things come to be acted, if they do but hear them tell them they are good, and they had rather ſuffer ſome diſorders in their houſes, then loſe a quarter of an hours paſſe-time. Theſe are they who ſhare the government with Princes, whiles they impoſe on them the burthen, and ſo divide the honour of commanding, thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king on nothing but delights, and ſuppoſing that as their births hath created them the chief in the State; ſo Fortune cannot but be propitious to them, for the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of whatſoever is neceſſary to give them a continual ſubſiſtance. It is for this reaſon it cannot be doubted, that it were neceſſary to keep their Favourites obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged very ſtrongly to the Kings ſervice, and to be dependent upon his Majeſties will and pleaſure, that they may be made uſe of as occaſion ſhall preſent themſelves for the good of the State. In <hi>Spain</hi> none are allowed to the Kings Brothers, but ſuch
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:56802:195"/>as are belonging to the Kings themſelves, which are changed too very often; leſt a long continuance in their ſervice, might in time beget too ſtrong a confidence and draw them off from the firſt ties of their obedience. For this reaſon it is, that there ought no great deliberation to be had for the removal of ſuch from them, who are experimentally known to ingage them, in affairs prejudicial to the good of the State; for the great compliance in permitting them a longer continuance neer them, will ſoon produce very dangerous effects. Their removal peradventure may ſeem harſh to Princes; but it is better they ſhould be diſpleaſed, then the whole State be indangered. It is a great good fortune for a Miniſter, never to be put upon ſuch a rock; and therefore it is, that he will indeavour to work upon them by good offices, which are the moſt powerfull means to oblige men and tie them very ſtrictly, the chains wherewith they are fettered, being ſo pleaſant and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to them. Intereſt, is that which doth moſt efficaciouſly more them: And indeed, it is in a manner impoſſible to gain them by other means, then by making proviſion for their advancement.

                  <p>JT is very uſual with Mothers to love their youngeſt better then their eldeſt chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and to rely upon them, to be maintained in the greater authority. It ſhould ſeem it is with Children, as with fruits, the neweſt are ſtill moſt agreeable, ſo it frequently comes to paſſe, that the youngeſt are pleaſures and diverſions to their Parents, when as they who are older, ſhake off the yoke of obedience, and follow the inclinations of unbridled youth; but moſt eſpecially ſo it is, when as mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers are become Widdows, and have loſt that protection of their husbands which kept their children within their bounds, that they do caſt themſelves upon the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt of the younger ones, whom they look on as the ſupporters of their old age, and as thoſe who muſt uphold their Authority againſt the eldeſt, whom they look upon very often, as men do upon Creditors who come to take away their goods from them; withall, they are dependent upon them in ſeveral reſpects, becauſe by the deaths of their Fathers, they are become the heads of their Families; and this dependency upon them is inſupportable. If this be ordinary in private Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, how much more is it in thoſe of Kings? Hiſtory is pregnant with relations of ſuch Queens as have advanced their youngeſt children to the Government, in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice of their brother. <hi>Ptolomeus Phiſeus,</hi> gave at his wifes perſwaſions, the Crown of <hi>Egypt</hi> to his youngeſt ſon; and to go no further then <hi>France</hi> it ſelf, <hi>Lewis</hi> the <hi>Debonnair,</hi> did not he prefer at his Wifes entreaty, <hi>Charls</hi> the <hi>Bauld,</hi> before <hi>Lothair</hi> who was the eldeſt?

And when ſhe ſaw ſhe could not arrive to the end of her deſign, did ſhe not embroyl all things, even whileſt the King yet lived; but much more after his death, by fomenting the diviſions between her children, that ſhe her ſelf might have the more Authority? This occaſioned a moſt ſad Civil War, to the great damage of the Kingdom and that good King, both in the declining of his age and Kingdom, when as he expected repoſe and tranquility in his family, eſpecially after he had ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered (upon his firſt coming to the Crown) ſo great afflictions by reaſon of the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes of his firſt marriages, &amp; their diſſolutions which afterwards hapned; for the remedying whereof, the godly Abbot of <hi>Fleury</hi> Abby was employed. Not to ſeek for examples far from us, is not that of <hi>Katharine de Medicis</hi> very certain, it being yet freſh in the memory of man, for ſhe was ever know to favour ſome of her children againſt other ſome?

The buſineſs them was to gain his Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites, who were three, <hi>Coigneux,</hi> the Sieur <hi>de Puy-Laureus,</hi> and <hi>Monſigot:</hi> But it would do the work if <hi>Coigneux</hi> only could be gained, for that <hi>Puy-Laureus</hi> had but a little before received a ſtrong Obligation from him; for having removed <hi>Bois-dennemay,</hi> who partaked with him in the honour of his maſters good affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and ſo would not offer to be againſt it; and as for <hi>Monſigot,</hi> he was ſo much his creature too, that he had no other motion then that of <hi>Puy-Laureus.</hi> There were great endeavours uſed to get him, and a favourable opportunity was ſoon found; for he being poſſeſſed with an abſolute unbridled deſire to have the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals hat, which the King had given him ſome hopes of, it hapned that the Pope deferred his Promotion for a few moneths, which he was upon the very point of granting: Some of them caſt it into his head that this delay was a trick put upon him by the Cardinal; ſo that he, as a man bewitched to his own ambitious Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts, ſwallowed it, and conceived ſo great a fury againſt him, that he reſolved to be revenged on him whatever it coſt him; inſomuch that he told a friend of his, who endeavoured to open his eyes, That he was freed from his hopes of a Cardinals Hat, but that within ſix weeks time they ſhould be glad to ſend it to him with a witneſs. It was his uſual ſaying, that a Son of France is alwaies conſiderable, if he be in a condition to make himſelf be pitied. And this maxime was the true ground of thoſe hopes which he conceived, That if <hi>Monſieur</hi> ſhould depart from the Court in diſcontent, he would be pittied by all people; That the Princes, Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours of Provinces and Places, and the chief Lords of the Kingdom would come to him, and bring Forces for his aſſiſtance, and give him ſuch means to raiſe and make a war, by which he would die that Cap in the blood of the people, which had not been granted to him according to his deſires and expectation. The true cauſe of its delay was this, The Italians would not give way that the Pope ſhould grant him that favour, unleſs they might be acquainted with the reaſon of it, it being contrary to the Bull of <hi>Sixtus</hi> v. which prohibited the beſtowing the Hat on men who had been twice married, as he had been; and thereupon all the Intereſt of Spain had much ado to promote the Duke of <hi>Lerma</hi> to the Cardinalſhip. As for <hi>Coigneux,</hi> he was much more moved by the hopes which they gave him of ſtep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping into the Cardinals place as ſoon as ever he was ruined; and he flattered him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſo much the more willingly into this Belief, becauſe having cauſed his Nativity to be caſt during the Kings ſickneſs, he had been told of great advantages of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune which ſhould befall unto him. The ſplendour of this pretended Miniſtry did ſo dazle his eyes, that he loſt his reaſon at the firſt motion of it, and was abſolutely fixed in the reſolution of giving himſelf to the Queen Mother, and to perſwade <hi>Monſieur</hi> to what-ever ſhe pleaſed: That he might give her a ſure teſtimony of it, he had the boldneſs to oppoſe the Kings will, when his Majeſty deſir'd to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage <hi>Monſieur</hi> a little more ſtrictly to the Court, by granting him that ſatisfaction which he had ſo long wiſhed for, of marrying him to the Princeſs <hi>Mary.</hi> The Queen-Mother who could not endure this match, aſſured <hi>Coigneux,</hi> that he would do her a moſt particular kindneſs to divert <hi>Monſieur</hi> from it; who forthwith uſed all the Artifices which the malice of his ſoul could ſuggeſt to him, to break it off, inſomuch that he beſeeched his Majeſty that he would not oblige him to marry ſo ſuddenly, <hi>Coigneux</hi> became ſo inſolently proud of this prank, that <hi>Monſieur</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at <hi>Chantilly,</hi> he vaunted (ſpeaking to ſome one who was not at all engaged to
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:56802:197"/>him) that he had hindred the Match, and that it would never be concluded. Its true, the words were no ſooner out of his mouth, but he repented them, fearing, and with great reaſon, leſt the King would come to be informed of his inſolencie, and chaſtiſe him for it. In fine, Fear was joyned to his Ambition: From thence forward, thoſe two furious Paſſions wrought ſo mightily upon his inconſiderate Spirit, that he was at no quiet until he wrought <hi>Monſieur</hi> to leave the Court. There was no eſſay which he left unattempted to ſhake that reſolution of <hi>Monſieurs,</hi> which he ſtuck cloſe to, of not forſaking the King: He found means to renew in his mind freſh ſentiments of revenge againſt the Cardinal, by remembring him of the Impriſonment and death of the Grand Prior, and of the Marſhal <hi>d' Ornano,</hi> and the execution of <hi>Chalais:</hi> He often put him in mind of the Obligation which lay upon him to undertake the Queen-Mothers quarrel, who had alwaies tenderly lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved him: But finding that none of theſe devices wrought any effect he attempted to poſſeſs him with fear, which ſhaketh the greateſt Courages: He made him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that the King had been inform'd of his relapſing into the Queen-Mothers Intereſts, and was by the Cardinal's advice reſolved to ſend him Priſoner to the <hi>Boys de Vincennes.</hi> Then it was that without more ado he abſolutely concluded to leave the Court with all ſpeed, not having the power to recollect (as it was to be wiſhed) that this Favourite led h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>I Have formerly ſaid, It were requiſite that the Favourites of Princes ſhould be nearly tyed to the Kings Intereſts, that they might be carried to whatever his Majeſtie ſhould deſire of them; and now I ſhall add, that it is not leſs then neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, to prevent their troubling of the State; for that the moſt part of ſuch Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil wars have hapned by their means: But there are great obſtructions and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties in the encompaſſing it, ſeeing that it is not ſomtimes in the power of the greateſt Miniſters to retain them in their duties, what-ever advantages are prepared for them. And as eating doth but excite the hungers of ſtarved ſtomacks, ſo thoſe Riches which are given to them, do but make them more ambitious of other, and greater. It is the humour which doth poſſeſs moſt Princes Favourites, and is the cauſe which doth often engage their Maſters in great Broyls. The moſt violent ſtorms which turn all things up-ſide-down, are formed only out of Clouds drawn up by the Planets into the higheſt Region of the Ayr; and the greateſt Revolts which have troubled the quiet of the people, and ruined whole Kingdoms, have proceeded from thoſe ſuggeſtions which Princes Favourites (the Stars of the State) have raiſed in their minds, from whence they often get nothing but mud and dirt. Hath not the laſt age made it evident here in France, in the time of <hi>Henry</hi> the third, when as the Duke <hi>d' Alençon</hi> had not gone out of the Court, but by the perſwaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of <hi>B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

Our own times have fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed us with examples enough to prove this truth, which are ſo well known to all men, that I need not trouble them or my ſelf to relate them. I ſhall only add this; that as Goldſmiths have a certain ſtrong water to ſeparate Gold from Silver, though incorporated by the Fire, that they ſeem to be the ſame Body: So the Favourites of Princes have certain Arts, which the malice of the Court teacheth them, the power of which is ſo great, that when they pleaſe, they will divide a Mother from her children, a Brother from a Brother, and generally all whom Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture or Friendſhip had joyned together, in ſo ſtrict a league, that one would have reaſonably imagined nothing could have been able to have made a ſeparation.</p>

                  <p>VVHen <hi>Coignenx</hi> had once perſwaded <hi>Monſieur</hi> by his ſubtle devices to leave the Court, he gave him no reſpite, until he had put it in execution. That his departure might be with the more noiſe, which might ſerve for a Beacon to put the whole Kingdom in an uprore; he found a trick to perſwade him, that it would be an act of courage in him, to go quarrel with the Cardinal in his own houſe, before he went off, and to declare to him, that he would be no more his friend, but that he would take the Queen-Mothers part againſt him. Accordingly <hi>Monſieur</hi> went to him, and told him ſo: But the Cardinal who knew ſuch things could not proceed from his goodneſs, which rendred him not only the leaſt evil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doer, but indeed, the moſt obliging Prince of the world, anſwered him with no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but reſpects and civilities. Aſſoon as <hi>Monſieur</hi> went from him, he got into his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>oach, and went directly to <hi>Orleans,</hi> without taking leave of the King. The Queen-Mother ſeeming to be ſurpriz'd at it, preſently ſent notice of it to the King, then at hunting; who was much troubled at it; though he could expect little good from the baſe diſpoſitions of <hi>Monſieur</hi>'s ſervants, of all whom his Majeſty had been fully informed, though he could not imagine they would have carried things to ſuch extremities conſidering the great gratifications he had beſtowed on them, and thoſe ſeveral proteſtations of inviolable fidelity which they had but ſo lately made unto him. When his Majeſty return'd from hunting, he alighted at the Cardinal's, and gave him ſuch ſingular teſtimonies of his favour, that they were able to obliterate any apprehenſions of <hi>Monſieur</hi>'s proceedings: His Majeſty pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed he would protect him with and againſt all, and commanded him to be the more confident of it, in regard he was bound in honour to preſerve him, from whom he had received ſuch ſignal ſervices. That if any did him an injury it was his Majeſty whom they did offend, and he would ſo take it, as done to himſelf. From thence the King went to find out the Queen-Mother, to whom he could not diſſemble how much <hi>Monſieur</hi>'s departure did diſpleaſe him, and the juſt ground he had to ſuſpect that ſhe had a hand in the counſelling him to it, of which for the preſent ſhe endeavoured to clear her ſelf, though ſhortly after it was found to be but too true, by that ſtrict intelligence which was between them, and by thoſe letters which they writ to the King, having one and the ſame ſenſe and expreſſion, As alſo by <hi>Monſieur</hi>'s own diſcourſes to the Ladies at <hi>Orleans,</hi> when they asked of him the reaſons of his ſo ſudden return; not that the Queen-Mother was ever ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with <hi>Monſieur,</hi> or he with her, but that there was a means found out to perſwade them, that if they would but cloſely unite themſelves, they would be the better able to drive on their own Deſigns, and induce the King to ruine the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal, the only thing which they deſired.</p>

                  <p>THough the Ring-leaders in a State be of different humors and inclinations, and though they be much divided by the emulation which they bear to one another, yet they do eaſily re-unite, that they may (if poſſible) increaſe their own Powers, by deſtroying that of their King. Experience ſheweth us, that fire can naturally incorporate moſt different mettals, as Gold and Iron; The fire of Ambition is no leſs able to unite the minds of Grandees, when it is once propoſed to trouble the Kingdom. One hath not obtained the Penſion or Boon which he deſired; another could not get his kinſman into a Benefice as he attempted, and another thinks he deſerveth to have a greater hand then he hath, in the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of affairs, or could not procure the Office which he aſpired to; and theſe are thoſe ſeveral diſcontents which they have received, in the diverſity of their deſignes, and which run them up to that paſs, that they become unſatisfied with the King, or his principal Miniſter, not at all conſidering, that there are ſeveral
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:56802:198"/>other concerns, beſides theirs in particular, which oblige by neceſſity, that thoſe things be granted to others, which they would ſo fain procure to themſelves. This general diſcontent is enough to unite them together, and to engage them in that one deſigne of a revolt: They know there are two waies to attain to greatneſs, Prudence and Power, when they once perceive that all the devices of their Will, or to ſpeak more properly, all their Deceipts, are not able to raiſe their greatneſs to that paſs which they deſire, they preſently fly to the latter, imagining in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves they might get more by it, then by the former. They cannot be ignorant how that many of their Predeceſſors have bee ſhipwrack'd on the very ſame ſcore, by which they pretend to raiſe great advantages to themſelves: and as the minds of moſt men abound rather with hopes then fears, ſo they fancy to themſelves, that Fortune will be more favourable to them then others; and upon this account it is, that they do often aſſociate themſelves together, not with intent of putting State affairs into a better poſture, as they pretend, but to advance (what in them lies) their own private Families and Intereſts at the coſt and charges of the Publike. I ſhall liken them to the firſt qualities, which not holding themſelves in a good cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondency, for the preſervation of the ſubject whereof they are compos'd, do unanimouſly conſpire and contrive the ruine of it; for in the ſame manner do they inſtead of keeping up and maintaining the State by their Prudence and Authority, of which it is their honour to be chief ſupporters, they employ them to divide and ruine the people, forcing the Prince to contribute to the means which are neceſſary to oppoſe their violences.</p>

                  <p>AFter <hi>Monſieur</hi>'s departure, the Queen-mother became more reſolute in her eagerneſs againſt the Cardinal, and believed that his going away would be very advantagious to her. They who flattered her, and blew the Coals of her Paſſion, perſwaded her, that half the Kingdom would quickly be up in Arms, and proffer their aſſiſtances to <hi>Monſieur,</hi> in what-ever he would employ them: That ſeveral Towns would revolt; That <hi>Monſieur</hi>'s diſcontent alone, if once known abroad, would raiſe a war on every ſide, and that amidſt this confuſion, the King would think himſelf very happy, could he but prevent the ruine of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, by ſubmitting to that of the Cardinal: She withdrew her ſelf from being at any counſels, to which ſhe had but lately before uſed to go, and ſeemed leſs ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous in diſſembling her diſcontents. What pity was it to ſee a Kingdom expoſed to ſo imminent a danger of being totally ſubverted by Civil wars, and all to deſtroy him, who for eight yeers together employed his whole time (both day and night) to ſettle it in its former glory? What Injuſtice was it to repay the Cardinal's ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces with ſuch Ingratitude?

The Reſpect where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:56802:198"/>the King did alwaies honour her was ſuch, that he could never reſolve to uſe any violent remedies, but at the very laſt caſt, after he had tryed all others; to which end he reſolved rather to leave her, then that ſhe ſhould leave him, and accordingly he removed to <hi>Compeigne,</hi> imagining that the ſharpneſs of the ſeaſon would invite her to continue at <hi>Paris</hi> after his departure, and that in this ſmall ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration, ſhe could not any longer divide the Court into Parties, as then ſhe had done. There were likewiſe other devices found to draw off ſome of the moſt facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous from about her, that their abſenſe might afford ſome opportunities of calming her ſpirit.

                  <p>HOpe is that Root which doth long nouriſh the Thought of Revenge, and without which the moſt generous perſons loſe their Courages, and fall into deſpair, inſtead of proſecuting their deſigns. No one hath ſo well deſcribed the qualities of that which is without reaſon, as the Ancient who ſaid, it is the dream of thoſe who are awake, and whoſe minds are maſtered with this Paſſion. To ſpeak truly, juſt as Dreams fill the mind with <hi>Chimera's,</hi> which have no other be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then in our Fancies, ſo an ill-grounded hope fills our Courages with illuſions and imaginary contentments, by repreſenting ſuch things which are abſolutely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond our reach, as if they were ſubject to our wills and deſires; it flatters our thoughts with a vain belief, that there is not any impediment poſſibly to be met with in our enterpriſes, which we ſhall not be able to ſurmount; and though at the very inſtant a ſtorm be over our heads, yet it aſſureth us that it will not laſt long, but that a calm will ſoon follow. If we are to begin a war, it makes us ſee an Army already in the Field, which nothing can reſiſt. If any enterpriſe threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en us with miſcarriage, it perſwadeth us, that we ſhall ſoon ſee ſome alteration in affairs, ſetting before our eyes the examples of many, who have been raiſed out of great misfortunes, to greater glories and honours. Thus it is, this ſame Hope which fortifieth the moſt dejected Courages, animates the moſt aſtoniſhed men with new ſouls, and recruits the reſolutions of them who were even languiſhing. Have we not ſeen it ſerve for an Anchor to the moſt miſerable, to keep them firm in all Tempeſts, when they have been upon the point of being overwhelmed, and for a North Pole, to guide them to their deſired Haven? Hope is that which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerveth neceſſary vigour for the executing of hazardous deſigns; our own Wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es never laſt ſo long as Hope doth; for we ſoon diſclaim our Deſigns, if we once believe they will not take effect. It hath alwaies been known for the Mother of Valour, and for a vital Spirit, which animateth the heart to great attempts. The charms of Hope are very powerful, but they are alſo dangerous, and much like the Egg of an Aſpick, which is very pleaſant to look on, by reaſon of that diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of colours wherewith Nature hath been pleaſed to paint it, but within it is
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:56802:199"/>full of deadly poyſon, of which time brings forth a moſt venemous ſerpent: For if in Enterpriſes there be nothing ſo dangerous as a miſ grounded Hope, yet the pleaſure wherewith it entertains our minds in matters of Revenge, is very dear to us, and makes us pay high Intereſt for it. It is the miſerable man's Treaſure, and ſomtimes too it is an addition to his miſeries. It is not enough that a hope be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to our deſires, but it ought to be laid by when it is grounded upon the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtances of ſome perſons who are eaſily to be ruined, or upon an Inſurrection of a people who every day change their reſolutions, whom a little fear diſarms, and who this day love him, whom but a little before they could not endure at all.</p>

But it is a hard matter to unite thoſe of the ſame Blood, after a defiance ſhall have once ſeized on their minds. From hence it is, that <hi>Micipſa</hi> in <hi>Salust</hi> ſaith, the greateſt force of a Kingdom doth not ſo much conſiſt in Arms, or in the richneſſe of Treaſuries, as in the good intelligence of the chief Nobles, which can neither be ſubdued by Arms, nor corrupted by Monies, but eſpecially in the friendſhip of Brothers, whoſe Blood ought to render their union indiſſolvable. The Kingdom of <hi>Cyprus</hi> had not been ruined, as <hi>Juſtin</hi> relateth it, but onely by the diſſentions of two brothers. The whole Eaſt, had not been ſubjected to the Roman yoke, but by the miſ-un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings of thoſe Princes who ruled in thoſe Countries. And no other mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune made way for <hi>Pompey</hi> to make him Maſter of <hi>Judea,</hi> then the contention of <hi>Hircanus</hi> and <hi>Ariſtobulus,</hi> who in envy of one another pretended to poſſeſſe the Crown. <hi>Philip</hi> well knew, of what conſequence love between brothers was, when as beholding the ſmall kindneſſe between his ſons <hi>Porſeus</hi> and <hi>Demetrius,</hi> he ſo often commanded them to love one another; repreſenting to them, that <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menes</hi> and <hi>Attalus</hi> at the beginning were ſo ſmall, that they were aſhamed to be called Kings, and could never have raiſed themſelves ſo high, but by their mutual and reciprocal affections, as <hi>Plutarch</hi> reporteth it in the life of <hi>Demetrius.</hi> Not to look after far fetch'd examples, what did ever bring <hi>France</hi> to ſo deplorable a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, as the reiterated diviſions between our Kings, the Dukes of <hi>Bourgogne</hi> and <hi>Orleans?</hi> Did it not reduce it to an eminent peril of Shipwrack, and expoſe it for a prey to Forraigners, who were only chaſtized by an extraordinary providence of Heave, which took a particular care for the preſervation of this Monarchy, when it was juſt upon the point of being ruin'd? Undoubtedly, a State is eaſily vanqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, when divided by thoſe of the Kings own houſe and family, diſorders ſoon follow thick and three-fold: The people following their example ſhake off obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; every one fiſheth in the troubled Waters; the poor are oppreſſed by the Souldiers; the rich have much ado to enjoy their Eſtates; Governours loſe their Soveraigns good wills, and do no longer ſtick to their intereſts, unleſſe upon their own private account; and in concluſion, forreign enemies make what advantages they pleaſe out of it.</p>

                  <p>THings being at this paſſe, was there any reaſon to defer the redreſſing of them? what colour could there be after ſo many perſwaſions, inſtances and entreaties to leave the Queen-Mother in the Court both animated and diſcontented, where ſhe countenanced a Faction, kept a cloſe correſpondence with Monſieur againſt the King, and divided the State? Had it not been an abſolute defect of all ſort of Prudence to have endured her keeping up of Combinations without the Kingdom, of which we have ſeen but too many ſad conſequences? To have permitted her party, openly to ſlander the King and his Government, to ſtir up the people to ſedition, to ſolicite ſtrangers to make war upon the King, under pretence that they had mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried her children? Had it not been an extream baſeneſſe, any longer to have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled the knowledge of that Faction, which would impoſe a neceſſity of driving away his moſt ſerviceable and confident Miniſters, and only becauſe they forſooth could not procure from them whatever they deſired? Had it not been an abſolute loſſe of common ſence, to have allowed their abrogating that reſpect which is due to their Soveraign, as God Almighties own Image? Could any one, and not be of this Cabal, wink at their endeavours to draw off his Majeſties moſt faithfull ſervants, from that duty which they owe unto him? Should one have expected untill the Engliſh or Spaniard had brought their Armies into <hi>France,</hi> to aſſiſt the revolt, or until the Princes who were of this party, ſhould have beaten up their drums and ſounded their Trumpets, for to lead their Souldiers into the field to have ruined the whole Kingdom with fire and ſword? To have done ſo, had been the moſt
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:56802:200"/>perfect piece of folly that had ever yet been heard of. Yet for all this was the King much troubled that he was forced to do ſuch things as would diſpleaſe the Queen-Mother, as to remove her, though after he had indeavoured all meek and fair means, which her Abettors had rendred in vain, though ſhe had laid off al natural thoughts ſuch as a Mother ought to have for a Son, and a Subject for a King, and though ſhe had, to her very utmoſt, ſtirred up both the French and Forraigners to trouble the quiet of the Kingdom. But at laſt the King began to conſider that the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe would grow worſe and worſe, if convenient order were not taken to prevent it, that he was bound to prefer publick before private intereſts, as thoſe of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſed Mother (and if it be proper to uſe the expreſſion) of a Mother revolted againſt him, which were things not to be conſidered at all; according to the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of one of the Queen-mothers Grand-mothers, who amongſt thoſe inſtructions which ſhe gave her ſon told him, that he ought to prefer without any diſtinction the ſafety of the Common-Weal, before that of any particular or private perſons. Withall, his Majeſty was not ignorant that as God doth ever prepoſe Univerſal be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Individual benefits; ſo Kings who bear his Image, and are his Vicegerents on earth ought to do the ſame; That if the Father Almighty did expoſe his ſon, who was one and the ſame with himſelf, to the rage of the Jews, he could not then be blamed for removing his Mother a few days from the Court, yet continuing to her all Honour, Officers, Goods, Liberty and Power, that ſhe could deſire, and this for the neceſſary good of the State, to the conſervation of which God had ſo obliged him, that he ought to prefer nothing before it. The King thought with himſelf, that thoſe great Honours and Lands which he had beſtowed on her, and that almoſt abſolute Authority, which he had alwaies intruſted with her, whileſt ſhe continued in her affection for his Majeſty and the publick good, would hold him excuſed from any condemnation, and would ſufficiently evince to all the World that he had not made uſe of ſo violent a remedy, but by compulſion and conſtraint of thoſe her Partiſans, and by the extremities into which they hurried her; ſo that judging within himſelf, that he ought no longer to defer his reſolution, he at laſt propoſed it to his Counſel.</p>

                  <p>WHen Eagerneſſe hath laid ſuch deep roots in the mind of Princes of the Blood Royal, that they cannot be eradicated by any poſſibility, it will then be abſolutely neceſſary to prevent their forming into Factions, which uſually ariſe from ſuch beginnings. There will unavoidably great changes ſoon follow in a Kingdome, where partialities have any ſway amongſt them. The very leaſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order which can happen between the Heavens, is capable of reducing the Univerſe into its firſt Chaos, and the diſſentions of thoſe who are neereſt related to the King, are able to bring a whole State into Confuſion, to tie up the hands of Soveraign Authority, and to expoſe all as a prey to Forraigners. The opinion which is held that it is proper to nouriſh ſeveral parties and bandyings amongſt Grandees, whereby to make them leſſe able to reſiſt their Kings Will, ought not to be underſtood of Leagues and Combinations to be headed by thoſe of the royal Family, which may attempt to impoſe a neceſſity on the King, to do what even they ſhall think fit; for ſuch a diviſion would lead a Kingdom into utter ruine, and undermine the moſt ſolid foundations of Monarchy. It is no whit leſſe inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to let Princes alone in any bad intelligence, for their over great union hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced ſad effects; it alwaies ought to be limited by the reſpects and obediences which they ow their King, for admitting it to be otherwiſe, their Factions being like impetuous winds, the popularity which is gentle and calm (like the Sea) would receive their impreſſions with eaſe, become furiouſly inraged, run into all diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and put a State into deſperate hazards. On ſuch occaſion no perſons ought to be reſpected. As the very greateſt are not exempted from thoſe puniſhments which the Laws have enacted for the Factious; ſo their enterprizes ought to be cut

                  <p>ALthough the Cardinal did very well know the reaſonableneſſe, nay the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of ſeconding his Majeſties inclinations to the Queen-Mothers remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val; yet ſuch was his modeſty, and ſo prevalent over his own diſcretion and inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, that inſtead of ſo doing, he on the contrary, rendred his often entreaties to his Majeſty, that he would be pleaſed to give him leave to withdraw himſelf from the Court. He repreſented to him, how that peradventure the Queen-mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther might thereby be appeaſed, and induced to leave the State in peace and quiet; and that for his own part, he ſhould willingly ſuffer himſelf to be thrown into the Sea to ſave the Veſſel, provided only, that his Majeſty would preſerve him in his affections, and not remove him out of any diſlike either of his Fidelity or Services. Nor did he this, as being ignorant of the obligation which lay upon him, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the place he held in affairs, of truly acquainting him with every thing which concern'd the good of his State; but onely that he might let his Majeſty perceive how little he regarded private concernments in this occaſion. Nor that he did not much eſteem the honour which his Majeſty did him, by intruſting him in the firſt place of the Adminiſtration; but onely becauſe the reſpect which he did bear to the Queen mother, ſurmounted the conſideration of his own greatneſſe. Not that he wanted heart in his perſecutions and afflictions; for it was well known, the greater reſiſtances he encountred in the Cabals and intreagues of the Court, did ſo much the more whet his Courage and Reſolution; inſomuch, that they could not at all move much leſſe ſhake him; but only becauſe the greateſt courages are moſt temperate; it being ſometimes more generous to deſtroy then preſerve ones ſelf.
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:56802:201"/>In ſhort, not that he wanted affection for his Majeſties ſervice, ſeeing nothing could more ſenſibly have touch'd him, then to have been deprived by his removal, of the means and opportunities to ſerve and defend him from the unjuſt attempts of thoſe who perverted by their wickedneſſes, the minds both of the Queen-mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and Monſieur; but only that he could never with a good will be withdrawn from doing her all ſervice, who had the honour to be mother unto his Maſter. How really was his advice any whit neceſſary to perſwade his Majeſty to remove her. Her own Actions beſpake her unto his Majeſty, and ſhewed him in words at length, that it was not fit ſhe ſhould any longer continue at Court, untill that time and truth had opened her eyes. Theſe were the true reaſons which induced the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal to deſire his Majeſties permiſſion to withdraw himſelf. But his Majeſty who well knew how great a loſſe ſuch a man might prove unto his State, ſeeing many Ages did hardly produce his Equal, and how that he had made the ſame uſe of him, that God doth of the Sun, that is, to diſſipate all thoſe ſtorms which might ariſe, not only refuſed to grant his requeſt; but on the contrary, weighing the great ſervices he did him, the remarkable advantages which <hi>France</hi> had enjoyed ſince his promotion to the Adminiſtration, as alſo the condition in which affairs now were, in reſpect of the diſorders and confuſion into which the Queen-mother endeavoured to bring them.

And what reaſon, I pray, can there be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, why a King ſhould upon the <hi>Capricchio</hi> of any Grandee whatever, either make a diſhonourable Peace which may render him diſ-eſteemed amongſt ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers; or remove from him any Miniſter, who like a good and Propitious Planet, doth by his influences cauſe his ſtate to flouriſh, eſtabliſh a good Order amongſt his people, and render his Power conſiderable amongſt his Neighbours? Who can think it any ſtrange thing, if he prefer the good of his Kingdom before their private humours, ſeeing his very own intereſts ought not to ſtand in competition with it? No King doth ever merit the title of Juſt, if he doth not tread under foot all his own pleaſures and delights, for the good and glory of his Crown. He ought to remember that his Kingdom is not ſo much eſtabliſhed for him, as he is for his Kingdom; and conſequently, that the good of his people ought to be dearer to him then any other conſideration whatever. Now, if he thus ought to prefer the

The very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenting of a Father ought not to be conſidered in this caſe, and who ſo doth any thing in detriment of the Publike good, to ſhew his Duty unto his Father, render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth himſelf culpable of a great injuſtice. The Authority of Parents extendeth no farther then the houſe, and in caſe they attempt to enlarge their bounds, he is not bound to obſerve them. Are not Kings the lively Images of God? If ſo, what more reaſonable Rule can they propoſe to follow in their Government then his Conduct? Now as God doth every day permit a thouſand particular ſubjects to ſuffer and periſh, nay, not exempting Kings themſelves, though of never ſo great uſe to their States, and all this for the preſervation of the world in good order; So cannot any one think it unjuſt, that they ſhould prefer the good of their State before all other conſiderations what-ever. And who is ſo ignorant as not to know, that Publike good is the ſubject of all univerſal Cauſes? The Sun, Moon, and Stars are perpetually ſending down their lights and influences here beneath amongſt us, becauſe they are neceſſary and conducing to the univerſal good, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome particular and private Subjects may ſuffer and be endamaged by it.

                  <p>AT the ſame time that the King departed from <hi>Compeigne,</hi> and had requeſted the Queen to paſs away ſome time from the Court, there were Orders given out for the ſecuring of the Principal Authors of this Cabal. Thoſe Ladies who
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:56802:202"/>were intereſted in it, were commanded to withdraw themſelves. The Marſhal <hi>d' Baſſompierre L' Albe de Foix,</hi> and Doctor <hi>Vautier</hi> were ſent to the <hi>Baſtille,</hi> where they received not any violence at all. The Princeſs <hi>de Conty,</hi> the Dutcheſs <hi>d' El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baeuf, d' Ornano,</hi> and <hi>Deſdiquieres,</hi> were commanded to retire to their own hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. The Princes, Governours, and other Lords then abſent from the Court, were ſo fairly dealt withall, that there was only courſe taken, that they might hold no further correſpondence with the Queen-mother, by having an eye upon their actions and telling them, that they would force his Majeſty to puniſh them; in caſe they did not ſurceaſe their Intreagues and Factions. What greater moderation could poſſibly have been uſed, and what greater Clemency could there have been ſhewed towards thoſe Factious perſons, who had ſowed diſcord in his Majeſties family, held intelligence with ſtrangers, attempted to raiſe civil Wars in the Kingdom, who had openly found fault with his Majeſties Government, traduced his moſt glorious and juſt actions, and who were come to that paſſe of inſolency, that they would compel his Majeſty to deſtroy him whom he cheriſhed as the worthieſt inſtrument of his Glory: But had they been continued neer the Queen-mother where they might have gone on in their agitations, what would they not have done, and to what ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities would they not have been tranſported?</p>
                  <p>Notwithſtanding all this, ſhe complained aloud, that all thoſe in whom ſhe could put any confidence were taken from her; and earneſt entreaties ſhe made, that <hi>Vautier</hi> might be reſtored to her as a perſon whom ſhe pretended neceſſary for her health: which was denied, he being one of the prime fire-brands of the whole faction, and one who inſtead of pacifying her Majeſties ſpirit (as the Cardinal had but lately obliged him, by promiſing him very great advantages if he did ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect it) had added fuel to the fire, and aggravated the violence of her Paſſion; but that ſhe might not have any juſt cauſe to complain, ſhe was offered to take her choice of above a hundred Doctors of Phyſick, in and about <hi>Paris,</hi> moſt of them much more able then him.</p>

                  <p>IT is not reaſonable to ſuffer them who are factiouſly inclined to rove at their own liberty, ſeeing Priſons are only made to reſtrain them who abuſe it againſt the Publick good.

It is hard to ſecure all; who have had their hands in a Faction; and indeed it were not peraduenture fit ſo to do; but however, the Ring-leaders muſt and ought to be reſtrained. It is very dangerous to wink at them, leſt the people apprehend too much mildneſſe; and beſides the favour which is ſhewed to them, and ſerves onely to give them time ſo to ſettle and contrive their deſigns, that afterwards it will be to little purpoſe to oppoſe them. <hi>Mucianus Vitell us</hi> was much commended in the daies of old, for having commanded his own ſon to be put to death that he might quench the flames of a War in its Cradle. The Duke of <hi>Alençon</hi> having conſpired againſt <hi>Charls</hi> the ſeventh, in the yeer 1474 was, not onely impriſoned but condemned to death. And the Duke of <hi>Bourgogne</hi> ſupplicating to obtain favour in his behalf, by alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging that he was of the Blood Royal and that his Anceſtors had done great ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to the Crown, was anſwer'd by the King, that as for being of the Blood Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, he was not the leſſe worthy of puniſhment, ſeeing he was the more obliged to have been loyal to it; and as for thoſe ſervices which his Predeceſſors had done, they ought not to be regarded in relation to him, ſeeing he had not followed their good example. <hi>Charls</hi> the Fifth, not only ſhortned the liberty, but the life too of a Gentleman who had dictated a Letter to thoſe of <hi>Gaund,</hi> in which they intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>Francis</hi> the firſt to aſſiſt them againſt him. <hi>Philip</hi> the ſecond, King of <hi>Spain,</hi> ſtood not in expectation untill his ſon had compleated that Faction which he had
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:56802:203"/>deſigned againſt him, and the State, but not ſparing his own blood, he preſently clapped him up in priſon upon his firſt notice and aſſurance of his reſolutions. <hi>Charles</hi> the Ninth, did not pardon the Duke of <hi>Alençon</hi> his own Brother, no more then he did the King of <hi>Navar;</hi> for upon his firſt knowledge of their Intreagues, he ſent them both unto the <hi>Boys de Vincennes.</hi> Did not <hi>Henry</hi> the Third, after conference with his Nobles at <hi>Bloys,</hi> threaten the late <hi>Henry</hi> the Grand, and the Prince <hi>de Condè,</hi> in caſe they did not conform themſelves to thoſe reſolutions which had been concluded for the good of Religion and the State?

                  <p>AMongſt the many other complaints made by them who abuſed the Queen-mothers Name and Seal in their Letters, this was one of the chiefeſt, that ſhe had not been removed from the Court, but only becauſe ſhe would not hold a fair correſpondence with the Cardinal. But is not this like the complaining of the ſick, who being fallen into ſome ſhamefull diſeaſe by their own faults, will by no means accuſe themſelves, but indeavour to impute it to ſome other cauſe more likely to juſtifie themſelves? Truly the Cardinal was no more the cauſe of the Queen-mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Removal, then Vertue is the cauſe, that Sin betaking it ſelf to all wickedneſs, out of the hatred it bears to goodneſs, ſhould by that means come to be aliened from God, who withdraws himſelf from it. It cannot indeed be denied; but that the King before her left he at <hi>Compeigne,</hi> did once and again charm her to love the Cardinal; and it were not amiſſe if the true motives which induced him ſo to do, were here layed down. The good of his State was chiefly in his intentions, and the neceſſity of withdrawing her from thoſe Factions which would ingage the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in Revolts, and all this to compel him, to deliver up this grand Miniſter, in caſe they could not effect it by the dayly inſtances which they perſwaded her to make unto his Majeſty. This indeed is the true reaſon which forced his Majeſty to part with her as himſelf teſtifieth in his Letter to the Governours of the Provinces, where true it is, mention is made of her refuſal to love the Cardinal, but it is likewiſe ſaid, that the hatred which ſhe bare to him, tranſported her to attempt things contrary to the good of his State, and the publick quiet, inſomuch that he could no longer permit her ſtay at Court. But who can impute her removal to the Cardinal, when it is well known how carefull and ſolicitous he was to appeaſe that anger which ſhe expreſs'd againſt him, which he did ſo effectually as to renounce his own intereſt and
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:56802:204"/>Fortune, and to ſue for his own diſcharge from the Court with that earneſtneſs, that his ſtay there may juſtly be ſaid to be only in order to his Majeſties Will and ſatisfaction, who expreſly commanded it, and to acquit himſelf of the Obligation which he had to acknowledge, by the continuation of his ſervices, of the honour which he did him; the King ſtill proteſting as great a reſolution to preſerve him as the Queen-Mother did eagerneſs to deſtroy him.</p>
                  <p>But laſtly, who can deny that a deſigne tending to ruine (what-ever it coſt) one of the chiefeſt pillars of the State, and him whom the King himſelf had often pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed to be the principal Author of his good, is not a crime <hi>Laeſae Majeſtatis?</hi> Were it not ſuch in any one, to attempt the deſtruction of any the ſtrongest places on the Frontites, or rather to invade any the faireſt Towns of <hi>France?</hi> Had not experience then made it evident, that the Cardinal was of greater uſe and concern for the good of <hi>France,</hi> then many Citadels, and divers of the beſt Towns in the Kingdom? He would eaſily have retrived them all, if ſo be any Invaſion of our Enemies ſhould have forc'd them from us, but it was not to be hoped ever to find a Miniſter qualified as he was, who was a greater Protection to <hi>France,</hi> then all the Citadels put together, and who by his Induſtry had made the King maſter of a great number of Towns and Cities.</p>

Thou haſt commitied an offence (ſaith <hi>Quintilian</hi>) but becauſe it is againſt the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, thou art therefore guilty of Treaſon. Whence it was that <hi>Verterius</hi> (as <hi>Plutarch</hi> obſerveth, was condemned to die, he having been defective in his reſpects to a Tribune, whoſe place is much inferiour to that of a chief Miniſter This was the ſenſe which Antiquity had of thoſe offences committed againſt publike per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and thus were they puniſhed who ſo offended. And who can deny theſe their Laws and Cuſtoms to be very reaſonable and juſt, ſeeing chief Miniſters are like the nobleſt parts of the Soveraigne, as is declared in the Law of <hi>Arcadius?</hi> And if the Prince be the head of his State, they are then the Members and Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments by which he governeth.

They are Stars clothed by their Princes with part of their own ſplendour, that they may the better guide the people by their Influences; they are the lively Images in which they cauſe the foot-ſteps of their Authority to ſhine forth.

                  <p>And what?

It is very dangerous to find fault with any of their Actions, which they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake in confidence, that they are well-beſeeming their greatneſs: If any one preſume to debate their Deſigns, by diſcovering the naked Truth to them, he will preſently be eſteemed but an ill ſervant for his pains: whence it is, that the moſt part of their attendants unwilling to run the hazard of diſpleaſing them, do not diſcourſe to them of any their affairs, but ſo as they think may be acceptable to them; they find by the daylie experience of others, both paſt and preſent, that this complyance of theirs is the moſt aſſured ſupporter of their Fortunes, and a far greater prop to them then Truth her ſelf. Thoſe Princes who are of this humour, never well counſell'd, there being but a few who would willingly for their ſakes renounce their Fortunes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> eſpecially ſeeing by telling truth they ſhould get nothing. Such counſels as thwart their Paſſions, are either eſteemed extravagant, or as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from a naughty ſervant. They are for the moſt part like that unjuſt Judge who demanded of our Saviour what Truth was, but would not ſtay to be inform'd. Great and many are the inconveniencies which by this means happen to them: for thoſe ſpecious appearances of Truth with which they are deluded, are like to thoſe Lamps ſet out on the tops of Rocks by <hi>Pirates,</hi> which inſteed of a Harbour entice the veſſels to their ſhipwrack, whereby they make a prey of their goods. An Ancient Author ſaith, That the greateſt pleaſure of the mind conſiſteth in the knowledge of Truth. But it ought to be underſtood of a ſoul free from Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and which only proſecuteth the Laws of Juſtice. And the Rule of the Wiſe ſays, Happy is the Prince who is ſo diſpoſed, and who knoweth how to eſteem thoſe who counſel him freely, without diſguiſing the Truth, for they, and only they, are the real ſupporters of his State and greatneſs.</p>

Such and ſo great was their wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs, that wanting ſufficient reaſons and inducements to entice her to their own bends, they ſought for ſome amongſt the Stars, and were ſo bold as to caſt the King's Nativity, and foretold her, that by the Poſition of the Heavenly Signs, his Majeſty could not long live; which being ſo, the Laws of Prudence obliged her to ſide with <hi>Monſieur;</hi> that ſhe ought in reaſon to look on him as the Riſing Sun,
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:56802:205"/>who would ſhortly ſit at the Helm, and whoſe favourable influences would be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for the upholding of her greatneſs. This foundation being thus laid, it was no hard matter to perſwade her in her Paſſion, that ſhe need not much regard the Cardinal, for the King once ceaſing to be, he would of conſequence lie at their mercy. Theſe were the vain wicked imaginations of certain malicious extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant perſons, which they went rather to Hell then Heaven, to learn out for the feeding of others ambitious humours, and to continue by this device the penſions which they procured from her Majeſty.

The Chaldeans (as moſt probably may be conjectured) were the firſt who diſcovered the uſe of Horoſcopes, but happy had been their ignorance had they known nothing of it. It is very commendable in us to fore-ſee by Prudence that which may befal us, but it is a foppery to ground the event of our undertakings upon the motion of the Stars. The Divels have ſomtimes foretold by the frivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous ordinary rules of Aſtrologie, what ſhall happen, but moſt men have attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the truth of their predictions, not ſo much to the ſtrength of thoſe Rules, as unto Chance; or as others will have it, unto their care to effect theſe things by them foretold. To deſire to know what ſhall hereafter happen, is to ſearch into that which belongs only unto God; and it is equally raſh to predict, as it is vain to pry into the knowledge of it. Notwithſtanding all this, there are ſuch as do ſuffer themſelves to be led away into this errour, and that upon two different oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions. Some, that they may avoid thoſe misfortunes which they fear; but it is commonly ſeen, that they who would fain ſhun the Rock, do run upon the Shelve. Others, that they may attain unto thoſe goods for which they hope; but to them it likewiſe happens, that crediting too much the good fortune promiſed them by the Stars, they come to run into diſaſters; if perchance they meet not that amongſt the Stars which they deſire, preſently they ſlight the Art; but if they do meet with any thing correſpondent to their minds, it ſo flatters their paſſions, that they are blind, and engage themſelves over and over, in ſuch enterpriſes, as do at laſt bring them to their ruines. There need no other reaſon to evince the ignorance of Aſtrologers then this one, that they are ſo little knowing of what ſhall befal themſelves in particular; for they know not how to prevent any thing, neither in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed need there more, then barely to examine with Prudence the Rules upon which they ground their conjectures, and it will then ſoon be diſcovered that they are Impoſtors, and that their knowledge is meer ignorance.</p>

                  <p>AS a Wiſe and Loyal Counſellor is the cauſe of a thouſand good ſucceſſes, ſo a bad one ſerves only to ingage his Prince in the extremity of misfortunes. Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ought eſpecially to beware of ſuch who make their own private intereſt their main buſineſs; for from ſuch they cannot expect any thing but diſ-ſervice, and they are obliged to remove ſuch from the Court; ſeeing they themſelves do but ſeldome take the pains to examine and diſcuſs ſuch affairs as are preſented to them, whence by the advices of ſuch men, they come to be oftentimes engaged in very dangerous deſigns. Happy are thoſe Princes whoſe Miniſters chief ends, are their Maſters glory; and this is his Majeſties preſent happineſs; for they being neither paſſionate nor partial in their advices, do alwaies adhere unto that which is moſt honourable: whereas they who have other Intereſts, or are prepoſſeſſed either with Fear or Ambition, do ever and anon infallibly fall on that ſide, by which they hoped to ſecure themſelves from the ſtorm, or raiſe their own Families. Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in their neceſſities have the more reaſon to complain, they then having moſt need of good advice: Faithful Councellors being hard to be met with in Courts; there is the place where Intereſt holds the chief Seat of its Empire, where it is more regarded then Kings themſelves; for the moſt part of their Attendants do ſerve them only for the love of it: Love and Loyalty are ſeldome admitted into thoſe places, it being uſual to ſue for a Princes favour, not ſo much to love him the more, as for the better effecting of ones own deſigns. Hence it is that the major part of their Followers give them ſuch advices, as they think to be moſt conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to their inclinations not ſuch as are according to the Rules of Prudence or Juſtice, and by this means they hope to acquire more favour, then if they had told the truth: Not that they are ignorant of what is good Counſel, but they think it unprofitably beſtowed, unleſs it contribute to increaſe their Fortunes. Now the beſt reſolution on which they can fix in this misfortune which inevitably will fall upon them, is, not to adhere unto <hi>Cleobulus</hi> his opinion, who (as <hi>Plutarch</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerveth) ſaid, That a wiſe Prince never ought to believe all which his moſt intimate familiars adviſe him: for that were to ceprive them of a very great advantage, when they are faithful and able; but that they ſhould well examine the qualities and ſufficiencies of them whom they adviſe withal, and then likewiſe to follow their counſels; not becauſe they proceed from them, but becauſe after a due deliberation, they are eſteemed good and reaſonable.</p>

But his Majeſty having replyed to him, that this was his only way to raiſe his Maſters affairs unto a height of good fortune, he made it apparent, that his overtures were only words, and that he was yet blinded with thoſe fond hopes which he had grounded on the laſt yeers State Almanacks, made by his means du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:56802:208"/>the King's late ſickneſs. He was very vigilant and induſtrious that <hi>Monſieur</hi> might make ſure of Monſieur <hi>de Bellegard,</hi> Governour of <hi>Burgogne,</hi> that he might might have the diſpoſal of the ſtrong places in that Province, as himſelf inform'd the King by the Sieur <hi>de Bouoarre</hi> about the end of February. The King likewiſe underſtood from other parts, that he had lifted divers of the Nobility under <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur</hi>'s name, in <hi>Normandy, Languedoc,</hi> and <hi>Limoſin,</hi> and that <hi>Fueillade,</hi> and others of the Sieur <hi>de Puy-laureus</hi> his kinred, did raiſe forces as freely as if they had had the King's Commiſſions. There was brought a letter unto his Majeſty, written by his direction from <hi>la Ferte,</hi> Lievtenant of <hi>Monſieur</hi>'s <hi>Gens d'Armes,</hi> unto his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, that they ſhould come to <hi>Melun</hi> neer <hi>Orleans,</hi> though it ought not to be done without his order. Every one knows that he had perſwaded <hi>Monſieur</hi> to write unto the Sieur <hi>de Thoiras,</hi> to intice him from the Court, and to draw him to himſelf. The Letter having been brought by himſelf unto the King, the deſigne in which this raſh indiſcreet Miniſter had ingaged <hi>Monſieur,</hi> of ſeizing on the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages upon the <hi>River Loyr,</hi> and of victualling <hi>Orleans,</hi> was every where known; His correſpondencies with <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Lorrain</hi> were publike; His confederates in <hi>Provence</hi> and <hi>Dauphine</hi> were diſcovered, ſo that it was eaſie to judge he had not the leaſt thought of withdrawing himſelf, but deſigned to frame the Body of an Army, and ſo raiſe a war. And moſt true it is, That in caſe the Nobility who were expected above fifteen days before his Majeſty departed from <hi>Paris,</hi> had come, or if thoſe who were imployed in levying of Forces had brought them according to the time appointed, he would not have made uſe of them to march out of the Kingdom, but much rather to have ſetled himſelf in ſuch a condition within, that he might not be ſubject to that Law which the King of Right ought to impoſe on all his Subjects. He little conſidered how eaſily his Majeſty had reduced the whole party of the Hugonots, how he had ſet bounds unto the Spaniſh Ambition, how that he had put the Engliſh to a ſhameful flight, in that very place which they had deſigned for a Theater of their own glory, and that he would but laugh at their attempts, which were ſo repleat with raſhneſs.</p>

                  <p>IT is not ſufficient in a Prince, who would attain glory, that he be not apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive of any dangers in war, or that he ſhew himſelf to be more deſirous of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, then fearing any misfortune, unleſs he conſider before he take the field, what ſtrength he hath; from what friends he can preſume to have aſſiſtance, of what force his enemies are, and whether he have Proviſions enough for his own ſubſiſtence. He ought to meaſure his Courage by his Forces, and not to attempt any thing above his Power, or againſt Reaſon. It is couragious to ſtop the eyes at all hazards in the execution of a Deſigne, but it is diſcretion firſt to diſcuſs all the inconveniences which may arrive, leſt he ingage himſelf in his own ruine. Who ſo doth otherwiſe, cannot eſcape falling into one of theſe two extremities, either he muſt fall with his attempt, or be compell'd to a ſhameful compoſition, after a diſcovery of his own weakneſs and diſcredit. Beſide, that raſhneſs is full of inconſideration, it is ordinary attended with misfortunes. They who give up themſelves to it, are for the moſt part reduced to a neceſſity of quitting their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns, with as little advantage, as they uſed conſideration in their attempts. The vain hopes wherewith it feeds them, makes them at firſt all fire; but their flame evaporateth into Ice, by their want of ſubſiſtence; It is blind, and fore-ſees not neither dangers, nor any accident which may happen; whence it followeth, that it is very unſafe, nay pernicious, to be guided by its Counſels, and that experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence telleth us, it ſeldome keeps any of its promiſes. The Hiſtory of <hi>Cambyſes</hi> King of <hi>Perſia,</hi> related by <hi>Herodotus,</hi> may ſerve to exemplifie it; he deſigned to make a war upon the <hi>Macrobeans</hi> in <hi>Aethiopia;</hi> to which end he ſent Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours to their King, who might under pretence of carrying him preſents, eſpie the force and ſtrength of the Kingdom; but the King ſmelling their deſigne,

But it had been ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feminate only to bewail amidſt their preſent misfortunes, and take no care for the future; the King advanc'd with all diligence unto the ſame Province, that he might keep the Towns in obedience, and purſued him ſo cloſely, that he had not the time to make himſelf Maſter of any place, which doubtleſſe he would have done, had he not been followed at hand by ſome or other, who might prevent his deſigns. Before the end of <hi>March,</hi> the King came to <hi>Dijon;</hi> and having ſecured the Town and Caſtle, gave order to the <hi>Sieur de la Grange Meſtre de Camp,</hi> to march with his Regiment into <hi>Bellegarde,</hi> which place <hi>Monſieur</hi> had left behind him; he ſent the Regiment <hi>de Piedmont</hi> into <hi>Auxerre,</hi> and <hi>St. Jean de Lone;</hi> he left three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred horſe in garriſon on the Frontiers, in ſuch places as were moſt requiſite, to ſecure <hi>Bourgogne</hi> from any incurſions, and the <hi>Sieur de Hauterine</hi> to command them, as Marſhal <hi>de Camp Monſieur's</hi> Miniſters did every where give out, that he had not forſaken the Kingdom, but only to ſecure himſelf from them who purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, but it was without truth: His Agents indeed having deſigned under his name to fortifie themſelves in that frontier of the Kingdom, his Majeſty was obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to follow them at hand, to prevent their effecting what they had contrived it being of great conſequence, not to loſe any time in ſuch occaſions; his longer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay could but have given them leave to ſecond their own with forraign forces which as was well known they had negotiated: But if he would not have left the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,

                  <p>IT is a great misfortune to a Kingdom, when a Faction is once fomented within its boſome; but that once being ſo, it were a great imprudence in the King of that Country, go give time and opportunity to the heads of the Conſpirators, to draw their forces together, wherewith they might carry on a War againſt him. He ought to be before hand with them, and not to ſtay until revolted Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are in a condition to put their deſigns in execution. He muſt not indeed be too credulous in beleeving all reports, nor take the field upon the firſt news of a Revolt; but being once well informed and aſſured, he ought no longer to delay. Thus <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander</hi> the Great, made not the leaſt ſtop, that he might prevent the riſing of his enemies in <hi>Greece,</hi> and he came ſo ſuddenly upon them with his Army, that himſelf brought the firſt news of his comming. It was his uſual ſaying, that a quick diſpatch in preventing an enemy, is the thing which obtains great advantages againſt him; for this reaſon it was, that <hi>Apelles</hi> painted him with lightning in his hand, which hath a motion ſo ſwift that how little ſoever it be, yet it reduceth eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing to aſhes. Grandees when once revolted want neither courage nor power provided they have but time to raiſe their Forces. They have for the moſt part, perſons of knowledge and valour neer them, who are capable of ſetling their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs in a good equipage, if they have but leiſure to effect it. For this cauſe, is a King obliged to go in perſon, and encounter them whereby he may break the neck of their Rebellion. A ſmall matter will ſometimes ſuffice to ſet all right again; the Kings preſence is a terrour to Rebels, and takes away their courages who are not yet come up, that they have but little will to ingage themſelves; and in caſe they return not to their obedience by fair means, he is then in a capacity to compel them by force, ſeeing they cannot be in a condition to defend themſelves. <hi>Henry</hi> the third, committed a great overſight by withdrawing himſelf from <hi>Paris,</hi> at the mutiny of the Barricadoes; for a Kings obedience diminiſheth the reſpect due to him, imboldneth the Ring-leaders of a faction, and animateth the fury of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. <hi>Bajazet</hi> the ſecond did not thus, in the rebellion of his ſon <hi>Selim</hi> the firſt, but ſhewed ſuch an undanted courage that he could never be perſwaded to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw himſelf, although the Janizaries of his Guard were corrupted; and ſo beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved himſelf, that what with Iris preſence, and what with the gravity of his words, they became aſhamed to forſake him, or commit the treaſon they had reſolved againſt him. <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth did the ſame thing in reducing the City of <hi>Gaunt;</hi> for being in <hi>Spain</hi> upon the firſt report of their revolt, he took <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

Now <hi>Cogneux,</hi> together with divers others of that Cabal, having gained ſome principal members of this Court, by informing them with all things, though quite contrary to the truth, had ingaged them ſo far in their deſigns, that they publikely exclaimed againſt it as violent, for ſuch reaſons as had been ſent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, which were as frivolous as falſe.

                  <p>PArliaments are no leſſe bound by the Laws of Prudence then thoſe of Juſtice, not to ſeparate themſelves from the King in State-affairs. I ſay, they are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to it by Juſtice, for for them to judge of ſuch affairs, were to aſſume a Power which belongs not to them; their firſt creation was by Kings, and that only to do Juſtice unto the people, as the Preſident <hi>de la Vaquiere</hi> told the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> Chancellour, who in his Maſters behalf moved the Parliament that they would preſs his Majeſty to come to <hi>Paris,</hi> and make uſe of their advice in certain weighty mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. The ſelf-ſame anſwer did the ſame Parliament make unto <hi>Louys de Bourbon,</hi> after his taking of <hi>Orleans,</hi> and ſending his Declaration unto them. <hi>Francis</hi> the firſt, prohibited them from intermedling in affairs of that nature, in the proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings commenc'd againſt the Chancelly <hi>du Prat;</hi> and after him <hi>Charles</hi> the ninth did as much in proſecution of the Arreſt which had been iſſued out for the ſummo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Prince, of the Blood, and Peers of <hi>France,</hi> to conſult concerning ſuch complaints, as tended to the good both of King and State. Thus, his Majeſty ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving impowered and intruſted them, with the hand of his Juſtice, that they might only preſerve his Subjects right each to other, they may not intermeddle in any other buſineſſe without particular Order from his Majeſty, who can only confer that Authority upon them. But how can they with any reaſon, diſſent from his Majeſty in State affairs, eſpecially in this particular of Declarations, which are ſent unto them to be proclaimed, when as they are not acquainted with the many cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances which induced them, without the cognizance of which, it is impoſſible to make any true Judgement? Were not this to determine things without judging of them, as alſo to do it without lawfull power ſo to do? But if they complain of their want of Authority, the Stars might as well murmur againſt the Sun, for not imparting a light unto them, as glorious as his own. They ought to recollect unto their memories, that that Power which makes them conſiderable, is no more na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural to them then that of the Stars; that from the King it is, that they receive all their Marks of Greatneſſe, and Badges of Authority, and that from him alone all thoſe rays do proceed, which make them ſhine in the eye of the people.</p>
                  <p>And if Magiſtrates would but look a little neerer into themſelves, they would eaſily perceive that they have not any power but what is derived from their Kings; it is from them that they hold their Authority, and which laſteth no longer then their Will and pleaſure: Hence it is, that all Bodies corporate are bound to take their confirmation from all new Kings who ſhall ſucceed to the Crown, whereby they might learn, that as they were created for the good of their Soveraign, ſo
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:56802:211"/>their ſubſiſtence depends meerly upon his Will and Grace. Peradventure they wil pretend, that what they do is to conſerve his Majeſties Authority; but why do they not then conſider, how they themſelves abuſe it by reſiſting it; and that whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt they violate his Authority, their own flowing from his, cannot remain entire and ſurvive it. When as the Moon; jealous of the Sun, attempts to obſcure his Rays, and ſets her ſelf juſt before his face, ſhe depriveth us of his light; but we all know ſhe loſeth her own likewiſe, and that ſhe receiveth her whole light from thoſe Rays which ſhe obſcureth. As true it is, that Magiſtrates who become jealous of their Princes Authority, which alone hath cloathed them with luſtre, and made them to ſhine in the eye of their fellow Subjects, and attempt to abridge their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties of their Power and Glory, cannot ſo do, without wounding themſelves, and eclipſing their own light.</p>

                  <p>THe Cardinals ruine, was the main deſign at which all they who were with the Queen-mother and <hi>Monſieur</hi> did drive; they verily beleeved, that in caſe they could induce the Parliament to impeach him, that then his Majeſty would begin to have is Fidelity in ſuſpicion, and to give credit unto thoſe Crimes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he ſhould be charged; but this was a reſolution very inconſiderately taken, ſeeing they could not be ignorant, that it lay not in the Parliaments Power; and withall, ſeeing they could not but know, that his Majeſty being better acquainted with his integrity and ſervices then any other perſon whatever, would never per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit that he ſhould be intreated with ſuch ingratitude. However, in order to this deſign of theirs, they cauſed a requeſt ſigned by <hi>Monſieur,</hi> to be preſented unto the Parliament, wherein he proteſted that the perſecutions which he had received from the Cardinal, had forced him to go out of the Kingdom. He deſired an inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Proteſt, that the Declaration made in the Parliament of <hi>Bourgogne,</hi> might not prejudice either himſelf nor his Dependencies, and that he might be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted as a Party againſt the Cardinal. This Requeſt indeed was one of the cauſes which ingaged the Parliament in the Declaration, of which we ſhall anon ſpeak, and which made them culpable, in not publiſhing that of his Majeſty. But the King having commanded the Requeſt to be brought unto his Councel, it was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered by Arreſt, that it ſhould be ſuppreſſed as contumelious, contrary to the good of his Service, the Peace of his Subjects, the ſafety of his State, and as preſented to that intent by thoſe who had induced <hi>Monſieur</hi> his Brother, to withdraw him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf out of the Kingdom, whereby they might eſcape the puniſhment of their Crimes, and traduce his Majeſties chief Miniſters, againſt whom no charge or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint can or may be given (although there were cauſe for it) but by way of hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Petition to his Majeſties own perſon, who hath the particular cognizance of their ſervices and proceedings. Beſides, his Majeſty not ſatisfied with this bare Arreſt, diſpatched a large Declaration unto <hi>Fontainbleau,</hi> to let his Subject know, that the evil Counſels which had been given unto <hi>Monſieur,</hi> had carried him out of the Kingdom, as thoſe given unto the Queen-mother had cauſed her removal from the Court, and that the Cardinal could not in the leaſt be taxed therewith, including a moſt honourable mention of his Integrity and Sincerity, concluding that his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty was well ſatisfied and aſſured by a long and continued experience that the Cardinals chief ends and deſigns did only tend to advance the glory of his Crown, and the good of his State; and laſtly, conjuring his Subjects and Succeſſours ſtill to preſerve his memory in their minds: Thus was this great Miniſter ſecured by his own ſublime vertue, and his high ſervices, from the violences of a factious potent Party.</p>

There needs nothing more to preſerve them in their Maſters affection, then the ſervices they do him, for thoſe alone will eaſily make apparent, that all the ſlanders ſpread abroad a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, are only inventions of ſome baſe people, who would endeavour to deſtroy honeſt men of their reputation, whereby they might be made uſeleſs amidſt their diſgrace, and that themſelves might get ſomwhat by their ſhipwrack; not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all which, they ſtill perſiſt in the proſecution of thoſe glorious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns which they have laid, and make it daylie evident, that ſouls which are truly great, do but laugh at thoſe who endeavour to injure them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and wipe off with their fingers ſuch Vipers, without receiving any hurt; neither will they be diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged from continuing to act what they have well begun.

Their addreſs dictates unto them to watch the time, when they may gain that from their enemies which they deſigne to obtain. Their Abilities are enough to ſecure them from diſcredits and diſgraces with their Prince, where it is impoſſible for him to get their like: In a word, thoſe excellent qualities of theirs, do diſcover unto them their enemies contrivances, and renders them Maſters of their own Fortune, which is impoſſible to be raviſhed out of their power.</p>

                  <p>IT is commonly ſeen, that good ſervices are rewarded with calumny: Envie is one cauſe of this injuſtice, her eyes being offended with the ſplendour of any noble actions; juſt as the Sun dazleth and decayeth eyes already ſore and weak. It is a paſſion which in ſome ſort runs counter with Gods goodneſs, which draws good out of evil; whereas this takes occaſion to injure and would great perſons, even from thoſe very actions which makes them moſt conſpicuous; the ſame relation which the ſhadow hath to the Body, ſuch hath envie with vertue: And as the higheſt mountains caſt the greateſt ſhadows, ſo the greateſt perſons are moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed unto envie and calumny: Private Intereſt is another cauſe, and to ſay the Truth, is the firſt and chief; for that it begets envie. All they who by their am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition pretend to have ſome part in the Government, do fancie unto themſelves, that Fortune hath caſt them ſo much the further from it, as it hath raiſed up them who now poſſeſs it: Now as for thoſe who do not pretend unto ſo much, but do yet aſpire unto ſome higher quality then that in which they are at preſent, they ſuppoſe they have reaſon enough to complain of the Governours of State, when that which they expect is not caſt upon them; the diſcontent which hereupon they conceive, is not unlike thoſe falſe Proſpectives, which repreſent things and objects unto the view, which neither are, nor ever were; and thus indeed their judgment being overſwayed by Paſſion, becomes ſo depraved, that they apprehend things in their conduct, far different from what they really are. I might add Ignorance amongſt the cauſes which produce ill reports againſt Miniſters; there is nothing but the out-ſide of their actions to be ſeen, their intents and deſigns are ſecret and unknown, at leaſt of ſuch as have any conduct; neither do they ever diſcloſe their drift and main end, whereby they may not give the enemies of the State opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to prevent their being effected. Which being ſo, it cannot be denied but that the ſmall knowledge of their actions giveth their enemy a great advantage to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim upon them. They ſeldom have any thing to object againſt them, but what ſeems to be defective, and they diſguiſe things ſo artificially, that they make white paſs for black, &amp; lies for currant truth, being very wary that it fal not into their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, how they have extraordinary intelligences, which ought not, nay which cannot be dived into by vulgar judgements. But above all the reſt, they are aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulted by ſlanders, when-ever the Grandees of a State are bent upon miſchief, they dare not openly to complain of their King, leſt they ſhould too much diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver themſelves, and leſt their rayling might pull down ſome vengeance upon them,
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:56802:213"/>which might prevent them from effecting their intentions, but they addreſſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to throw dirt in the face of the chief Miniſters, although in effect they ſtrike at their Kings Withall, they are commonly troubled at the ill-government of the State they diſtaſte the power and honour which the King confers upon them, and complain of the charge which is impoſed on the people. Theſe are the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of all the Manifeſts, which were ever made to provoke the people to rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. If we but look back on the Paſſages our own times, or thoſe before us, we ſhall alwayes find that Factious perſons have been alwaies diſcontented with the Miniſters of State, and againſt them have they ever made uſe of reviling ſlanders, as a moſt certain torch to ſet the whole Kingdom in a Flame. Examples hereof are ſo frequent, that we need not ſtay to recite them. Beſides, it may be found in all Hiſtory, that when by the Prudent Conduct of any Miniſters, they have been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to a diſability of being further troubleſome to the State by War and open Force, yet have they ſtill perſiſted to diſgorge the fury and rage which poſſeſſed them, upon their papers, fraught with poiſon and lies.</p>

                  <p>IT is a misfortune for a King to be expoſed unto ſlanders. Let a Princes actions be never ſo glorious, yet Man is naturally ſo averſe from Government that he is hardly to be reſtrained from evil ſpeaking againſt him who rules over him, not excepting God himſelf, as may appear in the particular behaviour of the Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites. But however it cannot be eſteemed for other then a monſtrous ingratitude, thus baſely to reward the great cares, which he undergoes for the publick good; neither can it be denied, but that ſuch reviling, whereby the reputation of his glory is endeavoured to be eclipſed, ought to be ſeverely puniſhed, and eſpecially when it tends to raiſe troubles in the State. It is much more juſt to honor the actions of a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign with reſpect, then to aſperſe them with blame, which cannot but be raſh and inconſiderate, unleſſe accompanied with a moſt exact knowledge of all his deſigns; beſides, thoſe Calumnies which are laid to their charge are ſo much the more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, in regard that admitting they do not drive men into a diſtruſt of him, yet do they undeniably dimini<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

That Lye which is reported with aſſeveration, does commonly leave ſome impreſſion in the mind behind it, though it beget not an abſolute beleef. Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is a Treaſure, which Kings cannot ſufficiently eſteem; this is it, which makes them venerable, not that it adds to their vertues, but renders their vertues more conſpicuous; not that it gives perfection to their abilities, but ſets off their ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour, and this ſplendour is it which maketh men more obedient and ſubject to their Wills and Pleaſures. Opinion governs the whole World, and gives Princes them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Authority in their very Thrones. Experience hath told us, that we are not apt to credit a truth, if reported by a Lyer; ſo likewiſe no one will eaſily ſubject himſelf to a Prince, who is commonly reputed for uncapable of Government; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing once in diſ-repute, he may ceaſe to hope either for obedience or reſpect; he loſeth with his honour, all the Love which was formerly payed unto him, and fear will not long ſtay after the loſſe of Love. Which being ſo, no one can doubt of the Juſtice, nay abſolute neceſſity of inflicting exemplary puniſhments on ſuch as have the boldneſſe to offend their Soveraigns by their Calumnies. He who doth not chaſtize them, doth expoſe himſelf to eminent dangers; for that men having once heard him ill reported of, take the lie for a truth, if the Authors remain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puniſhed; and thus conſequently, he will fall into ſcorn, and run the hazard of loſing both perſon and eſtate: And as he who puts one injury, inco<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

The Emperour <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> did one day upon the ſcore of a fiction raiſed againſt him, anſwered as became his Clemency, ſaying: If he who ſcandaleth his Prince doth it by way of Paſtime, he ſhould ſcorn it, if by ignorance or folly he ſhould pity him; if he did it out of Malice he ſhould forgive him. Which is only to underſtood of ſmall injuries, ſuch as are not prejudicial to the State; and which indeed deſerve rather a Princes Scorn then his Anger, whereas thoſe others deſerve to be puniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hed with ſeverity. Whence it follows, that no one can doubt but that theſe Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellers ought to undergo the rigours of Juſtice, their abſence having ſecured them, and his Majeſty ſatisfying himſelf, only by ſetting forth the nake ſincerity of his
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:56802:214"/>Intentions, and the juſtice of his Proceedings, in his Letters and Declarations. His Actions indeed were a defence to themſelves, being accompanyed with ſo much honour and glory, that there was not any aſperſion but vaniſhed at their preſence. But it cannot be expreſſed with what care his Majeſty was affected in the Cardinal's behalf; how ſolicitous he was to vindicate him; for he had not only not the leaſt thoughts of abandoning him to the malice of his Calumniators, but he rather un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook to juſtifie him to the life upon all occaſions, in his Declarations and Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters which he ſent unto the Parliaments of Provinces, to the Queen-Mother, and <hi>Monſieur.</hi> He needed not any Mediator with his Majeſty, for that he knows better then any other perſon, the ſolidity of his Counſels, the Fidelity of his Zeal, the Juſtice of his Intentions, the Generouſneſs of his Courage, and the Moderation of his Conduct. The greater reaſon therefore had his Majeſty to juſtifie and vindicate him unto Strangers, in regard the major part of affairs which are tranſacted in his Government, are only known to himſelf and his Miniſters, every one elſe ſeeing nothing but things in their effects. And true it is, his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty omitted not any occaſion of publiſhing his Fidelity and Services, but did it in expreſſions and demonſtrations of an extraordinary eſteem and affection.</p>

                  <p>KIngs are in ſome ſort oblig'd to defend their Miniſters from the aſſaults of ſlanders; They owe this protection unto them, in remembrance of their Fidelity, and that they may be the more affectionately engaged in their ſervices, for that they ſeldome attract the hatred of the Grandees upon themſelves, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by their reſiſting of attempts made againſt their Maſter's Honour and Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. It is impoſſible for a Miniſter to ſerve his Prince as he ought, and not to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content the chief of the State; for he is often neceſſitated to curb their ambition of advancing their own power, in detriment to that of the Soveraign, and then all the envie falls on him, as if the whole Government were in his hands; and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Counſels are all the denyals which they receive attributed: Which being ſo, what Reaſon or Juſtice can a King have, to abandon unto the mercy of envie, a loyalty, which (if not cheriſhed) will ſoon languiſh? Nothing does ſo much dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh the zeal which a Miniſter hath for his Maſters ſervice, as the diſcountenancing of him. The Prince that forſaketh him who hath done him faithful ſervice, is blind in his neereſt Intereſts, and beſides the blot of Ingratitude wherewith he blemiſheth his reputation, he expoſeth himſelf unto manifeſt dangers, by permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his ruine, who was the greateſt Supporter of his glory; which once admitted, he becomes like a City, whoſe Fortifications are razed, and laid level with the ground.

They who were the Contrivers of this Deſigne, were not to know how greatly the credit of a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter doth advance his Maſters Intereſt, by cauſing him to be readily obeyed by his Subjects, And experience hath evinced it in a thouſand encounters, that all things run into diſorder, where a Miniſter once loſeth his Credit and Repute.</p>

                  <p>THere hath been ſo much already ſaid in anſwer to thoſe aſperſions laid in the Cardinals way, that to ſay any more were needleſs in relation to his glory, but it is not ſo in relation to the end and drift of this Hiſtory; which is for the Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of ſucceeding Kings and Stateſ-men, how they ought to govern themſelves; for Soveraigns may here learn how to carry themſelves towards their Miniſters, by the King's behaviour towards the Cardinal, wherein there was an appearance of objection, though it was an effect of his Majeſties Prudence. Amongſt the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny accuſations laid to his charge, one of the chiefeſt was, that he had obtained from his Majeſty the Government of divers ſtrong and important places of the Kingdom, and that other ſome he had procured for his friends. Now theſe ſo conſiderable places were reduced unto Sea-Towns, <hi>Havre,</hi> and <hi>Brouage;</hi> and that theſe places were the more to be regarded, they being in his keeping at ſuch a time, when as there were endeavours uſed to bring ſome Forraigners into <hi>France,</hi> which could not be more commodiouſly effected then by Sea. The Contrivers of this charge were not well vers'd in the Hiſtory of late times, wherein they might have learn'd, how that the Government of <hi>Havre</hi> and <hi>Diepe</hi> had been united and incorporated into the Office of Admiral <hi>de France,</hi> by two ſeveral Declarations of <hi>Henry</hi> the third. Neither were they better acquainted with the paſſages of the preſent times, How that the Government of <hi>Brouage</hi> had been conferr'd on him in exchange of <hi>Diepe,</hi> it being impoſſible to intend the neceſſary affairs of Sea, without having ſome chief Sea-Port: Which being ſo, What reaſon can he alledge to quarrel at his Majeſties conferring thoſe Governments upon him?</p>
                  <p>As for thoſe which, his Majeſty entruſted with his Relations, I ſhall only ſay, that they were not comparable with thoſe favours which divers other Miniſters have received from their Kings and Maſters, though they never did the Tythe of thoſe ſervices which he hath. <hi>Annas de Montmorency</hi> was Mareſchal and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable of <hi>France,</hi> Grand Maiſtre, and Grand Chamberlain, and Governour of <hi>Languedoc,</hi> whoſe eldeſt ſon was Mareſchal of France, and Governour of <hi>Langue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doc;</hi> his ſecond, Colonel of Horſe, Mareſchal of France, and Governour of <hi>Languedoc,</hi> by Survivorſhip; and his third ſon Colonel General of the Swiſſes. One of whoſe Nephews was a Cardinal, another Admiral of France, and a third Colonel of Foot, and whoſe four Daughters were match'd into four of the chief Houſes of France, <hi>viz.</hi> that of <hi>Thurenne, de la Trimonille, de Candale,</hi> and <hi>de Vautadour,</hi> and whoſe power was ſuch, that <hi>Francis</hi> the firſt commanded <hi>Henry</hi> the Dauphine, afterwards King, to obey him in the Armies which he governed. I could likewiſe add, that there is not any thing in the Cardinals Family that may hold compariſon with that of <hi>Amboiſe,</hi> who flouriſhed under <hi>Louis</hi> the eleventh, <hi>Charles</hi> the eighth, and <hi>Louis</hi> the twelveth. <hi>Charles d' Amboiſe</hi> was Governour of <hi>Champagne,</hi> and afterwards of <hi>Burgogne,</hi> under <hi>Louis</hi> the eleventh, and ſix other Brothers which he had, with many others of this Nephews, were all advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by him.

<pb n="418" facs="tcp:56802:215"/>the Cardinal had at that time only two places which were of any importance, and his Kindred as many; whereas ſome great Houſes of France had more. Beſides what cauſe of Jealouſie could there be ſeeing he was every week twice or thrice at leaſt with his Majeſty, and ſtill brought with him a ſurrender of his Offices, it being in his Majeſties power not only to diſpoſe of his Charges, but of his Perſon likewiſe? He had indeed over and above the Government of <hi>Bretagne,</hi> But how? Was it not at the earneſt intreaties of thoſe of the Country, who conſidering themſelves to be invironed with Ports, concluded that he could moſt effectually eſtabliſh their Trade (by means of his Superintendency upon the Sea) which had been much decayed during the late Governours times, becauſe of the frequent dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences between them and the Admirals of France, each of them pretending to command upon the Sea coaſt? That which made theſe factious exclaim more loud then all the reſt, was, becauſe his Majeſty had diſcharged ſome Governours from their places, and committed them to him. But what? Was not his Majeſties ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a piece of great Diſcretion, when he foreſaw the ruine of the Kingdom by the little obedience of ſuch Governours, who having the poſſeſſion of Towns and Places in their Families a long time together, would hardly be perſwaded they were beholding unto his Majeſty for continuing them unto them, but would preſently fly out into Rebellion, upon the firſt noiſe of any inſurrection? Hereupon his Majeſty reſolved to puniſh them according to their deſerts, and deprived ſome of them of their Offices and Governments, with intent of beſtowing them on ſuch perſons, of whoſe fidelity he was well aſſured, as upon thoſe of the Cardinals Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, who were never ſeen to intermeddle in any Cabal againſt his Majeſties ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice and who knowing the honour of his Majeſties favour to be the only ſupport of their Fortunes were careful of not being ingaged in ſuch Deſigns, as might make them unworthy of it. The advantage which this alteration brought with it, was ſoon after apparent; for how would it have been if one had continued Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of <hi>Breſt,</hi> if another had kept his Government of <hi>Brouage,</hi> and if <hi>Calais</hi> had not been diſpoſſeſſed of its Commander? would they not have ſerved for ſo many Citadels and Magazins to countenance all Revolts which they deſigned? And what I pray is become of all thoſe places which were entruſted with the Cardinal or his Allies, Have they not continued in their Obedience to his Majeſty, and thoſe who engaged the Queen-Mother and <hi>Monſieur</hi> in their differences, could not diſpoſe of any of them according to their own deſires? And that indeed was the only and chief motive of their complaints.</p>

                  <p>NOthing gives greater tranquility to a State, then the diſpoſal of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments into the hands of ſuch perſons whoſe affection and fidelity are well known unto their Prince. The experience which <hi>France</hi> hath ſo often had, hath been too ſad to be forgotten, ſeeing the moſt part of Civil wars, nay of Forraign too, had not been broached, but by the defect of Governours, more ſolicitous of their own Intereſts then of their Maſters glory and ſervice. Few are the Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dees who are not diſcontented, if they have not Governments conferr'd upon them, nay, if they have not ſome kind of aſſured ſettlement in their Commands, that their Authorities may be greater. A King therefore is obliged to be the more inquiſitive, whether with their Gandeur they have loyalty and zeal for his ſervice, otherwiſe it were only to give them the means of combining one with the other to raiſe Factions, and to diminiſh the Soveraign, by advancing their own private power. Admit they be diſcontented, 'tis without cauſe; for no one hath any right to preſcribe a Law to his Prince, how he ſhall chuſe ſuch perſons as he is pleaſed to employ in his ſervice. It is prudence not to regard ſuch diſcontents, they are inconſiderable, when the publike Peace is in queſtion. A King cannot diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute his Governments with more diſcretion, then by intruſting them with ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons whoſe loyalty is impregnable, and who he is aſſured will never intereſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:56802:215"/>with any party but his own, if any Diviſion ſhould ariſe. Now of whom can he better be aſſured, then of ſuch a Miniſter, of whoſe fidelity he receives daily teſtimonies, and who, when he ſees him, brings with his Perſon all the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments and Charges which have been conferred upon him? As for thoſe rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to him, ſeeing they abſolutely depend upon him, and that their Power is as his own, dependant upon his Majeſties good favour, they are equally obliged to be faithful. For this reaſon it is, that the greateſt Princes have not only not been backward to beſtow the chief Governments upon them, but have looked upon it as a thing very neceſſary for their ſervice. Touching the diſtribution of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, I add, That a King is obliged, what he may, to diſplace thoſe perſons who have enjoyed their Offices any long time, unleſs he be very well aſſured of their fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity; they are ſo uſed to hold them, when long continued, that the fear of lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing them, doth oftentimes engage them in ſome Faction, which gives them hopes of a longer continuance; Beſides, when not received by his Majeſty, but his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſors, they are the ſooner ingaged in a Faction, becauſe they think not them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves beholden to him for them; Withal, in proceſſe of time they get ſo abſolute a Power, that ſomtimes it exceeds their Maſters; it being uſual, that long com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand is accompanyed with pride and inſolence. Hence it is, that in the moſt po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litique States their Governments were never but temporary. <hi>Rome</hi> loſt her Liberty by continuing her Magiſtrates too long in their Power; and <hi>Caeſar</hi> could never have maſtered his own Country, but by acquiring too great a Power over the ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers by his long command.</p>

                  <p>RIches are the leaſt rewards which Kings can beſtow upon their Miniſter, for that in themſelves they are the leaſt of all other goods. Can any one deny Kings to be much indebted to their Miniſters, ſeeing they are the moſt worthy In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments of their glory, and that by their endeavours it is that they effect ſuch exploits, as render their memories immortal? For how much are ſuch riches be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath ſuch great ſervices? They are Fortunes may-games, and only uſeful to paſs away the neceſſities of life; moſt commonly they bring more care then pleaſure with them, and are equally common with the greateſt perſons, and thoſe who never obliged the State by their ſervices to reward them The Geeſe of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitol were well fed at the expence of the Common-wealth, becauſe by their noiſe they diſcovered the ſurpriſal which the French intended. A Dog that ſet upon certain ſacrilegious men, was maintained at the Publike charge. An Horſe that carried his Maſter out of danger was for ever freed from labour: And ſhall not a grand Miniſter after the rendring moſt ſignal ſervices to his Maſter and Country be rewarded with more then common advantages? I may add, that it is neceſſary for a great King to confer great benefits upon a Miniſter whom he hath found faithful and couragious in thoſe things which relate to his ſervice, whereby he may give him more authority and power to go through with all ſorts of enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſes tending to his glory. The greateſt <hi>genius</hi> hath occaſion of them to make himſelf potent in affairs, and without them his vigour will be feeble. He is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to ſtifle a thouſand noble exploits in his thoughts, for want of means to bring them forth. It is well if he be indued with generous inclinations; but if im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency aſſault him, it diſ-incourageth him: Beſides the affairs of the world are ſo diſpoſed, and mans thoughts ſo fixed, that all yeild and give place to riches. They may all, and do all amongſt men, and we ſee them acquire as much credit and authority to their owners, whereas they who are deſtitute of them, are inconſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able To wave theſe acknowledgements due to Miniſters, who is ignorant that Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Majeſty attracts no leſs glory from liberality then juſtice? One of thoſe perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions which render God moſt worſhipful to men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is his Bounty, that inexhauſtible fountain of all good things, which (like the Sun) diſperſeth his favours like ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny rays upon the earth, and is as beneficial as active. The gifts which Kings beſtow, carry with them as much credit as profit to the receivers; they bind the affections of their ſervants, not by their worth, but as ſo many teſtimonies of good will, the greateſt Bond which ties them to their ſervice. Liberality in a King is properly termed magnificence, they being obliged to do great good, and nothing is more beſeeming their Majeſties, then beſtowing great gifts. The perfection of the work is an aſſured mark of perfection in the workman; whence certain it is, that God acquired more glory when he created men and angels, the chief workmanſhip of his hands, then when he made other creatures: Equally true it is, that that which makes the riches of Kings more admired, is the eſtabliſhing of ſome great Families; and our Anceſtors did not acquire greater glory of being rich and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>IT is an ancient judicious ſaying, that as Roſes grow upon Thorns, ſo truth is ordinarily made to appear amongſt the ſharpeſt calumnies, for they that find themſelves concern'd, are compelled to diſcover it for their own juſtification; ſo thoſe factious ſpirits who indeavouring to offend the Cardinal, abuſed the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the Queen-mother and <hi>Monſieur,</hi> makes me take notice of thoſe truths which their malice conſtrains me to publiſh. But as they did not with only two accuſations ceaſe from their reproaches, we ſhall have occaſion to diſcover the reſt of their falſities. They would have the World believe, that this eminent Miniſter of State had ſo great a dominion over the Kings ſpirit, that his Majeſty gave an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute credit to all he did, and was wholly moved by his influences; and that all affairs depended on his Empire over him. But all <hi>Europe</hi> knew ſufficiently that his Prudence and Generoſity equalled his juſtice; and theſe ſeditious people, ſeemed like thoſe that ſhoot againſt Heaven, and ſee their Arrows fall back again at their feet. Nay, I am confident, they themſelves had not that opinion of his Majeſty they being in their attendances too near his perſon, to be ignorant how impoſſible it is to draw him to any reſolution without ſtrong and pertinent reaſon, and that Heaven hath ſo enlightned his ſpirit, that he can diſcern the depths of the moſt great and myſterious affairs: But they only publiſh theſe things for a pretext of their mutiny, by the example of ſome in the laſt age, at <hi>Rouen</hi> and <hi>Valence.</hi> O ſtrange fury! to render that a weakneſſe in the moſt puiſſant King of the World, which is a true effect of his wiſedom, when he ſaw in the Government of his eſtate that no affair whatever preſents it ſelf, of which the Cardinal doth not fore-ſee the end, conſequences, and cauſes; that there is no inconveniency which he doth not remedy; no danger which he doth not both prevent and ſecure; that there is no difficulty which he finds not the means to compaſſe, and that he never propoſed any enterpriſe, which he did not happily bring to paſſe. Why then ſhould not his Majeſty follow his Counſels, ſeeing his ſpirit, is, as it were, forced by the ſolidity of his reaſons to apprve them.</p>

                  <p>AS a King cannot too much confide in a Miniſter, when he is throughly aſſured of his prudence and fidelity; and if himſelf be of excellent parts, he will not ſcruple it, it being an aſſured ſigne of judgment to conform a mans actions to the counſel of wiſe men: ſo he ought to truſt him the more cheerfully in affairs of mean conſequence, when the temper of his genius aſſures him that he will acquit himſelf with honour; And that is unbeſeeming a great Monarch, to trouble him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with trivial matters. He who is not happy enough to have a Miniſter thus able, is compelled to take the conduct upon his ſhoulders, but ſurely he is much to be pityed; God having not put the Crown upon the Head of Sovereigns, to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain their minds with trivial affairs. <hi>Tiberius,</hi> one of the greateſt Monarchs that governed the Romane Empire, being retired for his greater quiet, into the Iſle of <hi>Cherre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

Thus <hi>Themiſtocles,</hi> one of the greateſt Stateſmen of of his time ſaid, as <hi>Plutarch</hi> acquaints us, that as the Ship of <hi>Salavere</hi> (which may be likened to the <hi>Bicentaure</hi> of <hi>Venice</hi>) never Launched out into the Sea, but for the reception of Princes, or ſome extraordiniry occaſion: So the Common-wealth of <hi>Athens</hi> ſhould not make uſe of him but in high and difficult matters. Now as for matters of great conſequence, it will be his advantage to be directed by his Counſel, he having often made appear that his prudence is furniſhed with moſt infallible means to bring them to an happy iſſue: The honour which herein he
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:56802:217"/>doth him, is ſo far from taking off from his own authority, that on the contrary, it doth rather raiſe his greatneſs, and advanceth his affairs to that pitch which himſelf would moſt deſire for his glory. It is dangerous preſumption in any Prince to be wilfully bent upon his own judgement; ſuch an one is in a Road that leads directly into ruine. The neceſſity of counſel is not to be avoided; they ought to remember that God who is ſolicitous to keep the greateſt Monarks within the bounds of modeſty and humility, hath as well ſubjected them to the neceſſity of Counſel, as the reſt of men unto them. The moſt Prudent are alwaies the moſt ſtayed and it is generally agreed, that to be wedded to ones own opinion contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the ſences of great men, is an aſſured mark of want of diſcretion, becauſe eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one is blind in his own affairs. I may hereunto adde, that this ſtayedneſſe is a bond which themſelves impoſe upon their own abſolute power, whereby they are bond which themſelves impoſe upon their own abſolute power, whereby they are preſerved within the limits of their duty, not ſuffering themſelves to be tranſported by the impetuouſneſſe of their paſſions. Nature hath not formed Princes more then other men ſo perfect, that they ſhould alwaies ſwim in the right ſtream, and never erre, unleſſe they have ſome one who may ſerve them for a guide: The greateſt Princes are moſt ſubject to be ſingular in their own opinions, they having more authority; it being moſt certain that a great power doth eaſily tranſport the mind into licentiouſneſſe. It is my opinion, that no greater harm can betide them, then to want ſome perſon neer them, whom they reſpect<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and who may have the liberty of adviſing them, as he ſhall find moſt expedient, whoſe advice they may fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low with a reſpectfull condiſcention.</p>

It is a burthen to them to demand part of that for the King, which they got not but with pain, nor do injoy in any great plenty. But it is without cauſe, for that the impoſitions were neceſſary, and there was not any miſ-government in the diſpoſal of the treaſures. Now that thoſe Impoſitions ſo much cried out upon, were unavoidable, cannot be doubted; becauſe thoſe Wars and Deſigns began after his comming to the Adminiſtration: In conſideration whereof, thoſe Charges im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, where abſolutely neceſſary. They were ingaged to allay the factious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolency of the Hugonots, to ſuccour Allies, to ſuppreſſe the ambition of the houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> who after the invaſion of our neighbours, would aſſuredly have made their attempts upon this State.</p>
                  <p>This being ſo, who can deny them to have been neceſſary? which admitted, the Impoſitions could be no leſſe; and I may ſafely add that thoſe very factious ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits themſelves were oftentimes the cauſes of raiſing the Taxes, by cauſing more by half to be expended in the Wars of <hi>Piedmont,</hi> by the delays they gave the Troops in detaining them ſo long; beſides they forced his Majeſty to keep an Army a long time on foot, purpoſely that he might watch and prevent their deſigns. Wars and Taxes do conſtantly march hand in hand, and the ſame pace; poverty ſerving only to bring an Army into diſorder; if it be a fault to make the people contribute to the charge, it is much more blame-worthy to ſee a State laid open to their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.

<pb n="423" facs="tcp:56802:217"/>neceſſary, do they not know what great advantages they gave both to the King and Kingdom? The glory will remain for ever, but the incommodity is already forgotten. What reaſon is there to complain? I ſhall onely make this anſwer, the Miniſters had deprived the King of that great honour which he now enjoys, had they been deficient in drawing from the people thoſe things which were neceſſary for the ſubſiſtance of Armies during the Wars, and that it was a certain ſign of their good conduct, to have made ſuch carefull proviſions. If the Impoſitions were thus neceſſary, the money which did riſe from them, was no leſſe carefully expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded during thoſe times of which they ſpeak; in which it may be ſaid, much was done with little money. Can any one deny, that this incomparable Miniſter did not buy that glory and thoſe victories for the King, to the ſhame of his enemies, at an eaſier rate then others have done, who have onely uſed allaying Medicines to defer thoſe evils which afflict us from exaſperating into extremities, but have ſtill left the enemies of <hi>France</hi> great advantages upon us? It muſt be confeſſed, that ſome particular people have beene charged over and above their proportion, but neither the King nor his Miniſters are therefore to be blamed; the Poſſeſſors, and Raters were faulty, and deſerved to be puniſhed, becauſe they oppreſſed the weak, and let the able eſcape upon the ſum of friendſhip.</p>

                  <p>JUſtice and Prudence do equally oblige a Prince, to force a contribution from his Subjects, towards the urgent neceſſities of the publike. No one can doubt whether any thing be more efficacious then a good Treaſure to preſerve a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in order, be it in Peace or War. That Prince is eaſily ſurprized, whoſe Exchequer is exhauſted; for he that wants money, wants wherewith to levy men, and he who is defective of men, is to be vanquiſhed without difficulty. Now as to matter of War, every one knows, that Monies are its principal Nerves, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon <hi>Suetonius Paulinus</hi> a Captain of great repute, ſaid in the Emperour <hi>Otho's</hi> Councel, where the means of carrying on a War, were diſcuſſed; that in publike diſſentions Money was more neceſſary then an Army. Hath not <hi>Thucydides</hi> recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to us, how the chiefeſt arguments which <hi>Pericles</hi> uſed to induce the Athenians to make War, was by convincing to them, that they were in a capacity of ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, becauſe an Army would eaſily be ſupplied with all neceſſary proviſions, from that abundant Treaſure, of which they were Maſters? War is undeniably a great Gulf which devoureth incredible ſums: What imprudence therefore were it for a Prince, who finding himſelf ingaged in Wars, and the Revenue of his Crown un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to furniſh him with neceſſary conveniences, not to compell his Subjects to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute towards the publike Concernments? Would he not ſoon be reduced to the condition of <hi>Cleomenes;</hi> who according to <hi>Plutarch</hi> were forced to a War, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out monies to ſupport his Souldiery, was compelled to flie into <hi>Egypt?</hi> If there be any thing of Prudence in it, there is as much of Juſtice too. The common <hi>Axiom</hi> is, that every one may make uſe of his own; now is it not, I pray, moſt certain that Kings may rightfully impoſe Contributions upon their Subjects towards the defraying of publike expences? It is a right ſo undubitable inherent to them, that the moſt able and ſincere Divines, aſſure us, that every one is in conſcience bound to ſubmit to it, they grounding themſelves upon that command which our Saviour gave of paying unto <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and the example which himſelf ſhewed. Herein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth the Soveraign power which Kings have over their Subjects goods. I ſhall moreover adde, that a Crown doth not only impower to impoſe Taxes, but doth oblige Kings to require them, for the preſervation of its luſtre, and to demand them, as a debt due to the State, as alſo that no Subject can reaſonably complain of it, it being but juſt, that particular and private perſons ſhould ſuffer ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodity for the preſervation of the publike good; and better it were a Nation were impoveriſhed, then a kingdom loſt.</p>

                  <p>THoſe crimes wherewith the Cardinals honour was taxed were ſo frivolous, that we need not any longer detain our ſelves upon them, eſpecially ſeeing all wiſe men knew them to be groundleſſe. Eaſie it is to ſpeak ill of the Governours of a State, as the Queen mother her ſelf once ſaid, to ſome who complained of her Agents<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> during her Regency. Every one takes the liberty to diſcommend their Conduct, becauſe Man is naturally an enemy to Government, and propenſe to judge the worſt of his Governours, whoſe actions indeed may appear in their true Colours, but not the cauſes, inducements and circumſtances of them, they remain lock'd up in ſecret. Revilings are the rewards of their watchings, and let their actions be never ſo advantagious to the publike good, yet private particular perſons ſhall never be ſatisfied or pleaſed with them unleſſe they advance their private and particular Fortunes, as well as that of the publike. Never was yet Miniſter other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe rewarded; and for this very reaſon, whatever was ſaid againſt the Cardinal, was regarded by wiſe men; but as the effect of a furious faction, who could not meet their particular advancement in his Conduct, which he little eſteemed after he found their ends to be guided by their intereſts, without conſideration of the Kings Honour, ſo that it will be needleſſe longer to inſiſt on this particular diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe.</p>
                  <p>Shortly after the Queen mothers and <hi>Monſieur's</hi> departure, the King unwilling to hinder their Officers from going after them, was well inform'd that divers abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing that Liberty accorded unto them, did carry Letters under the notion of Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, and packets of correſpondency, for the continuing many Intreagues ſtill on foot.

The Pilot ſeems ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly employed during the Tempeſt, if he preſerve his Veſſel from the violence of the Winds, and fury of the Waves, his preſence and command being neceſſary to guide all thoſe who have any charge to the performance of their Offices, and his prudence to incourage them to go through ſtitch with any thing which conduceth to his hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py ſucceſſe; ſo it is hard to beleeve that a Miniſter of State hath not as much em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment as humane wit can undergo, when he is obliged to defend himſelf and the State too, from the violence of a faction headed by the chief perſons of the royal fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, ſeeing he muſt neceſſarily every day iſſue out a thouſand ſeveral Orders, and hardly will any one beleeve that he can be capable of any other thoughts, whiles he is agitated in ſuch furious Tempeſts: True it is, the higheſt pitch of glory that a Miniſter in ſuch encounters can attain to, is to avoid ſhipwrack. Experience hath made it evident that great Souls can paſſe further on, and that as the intelligences though taken up in their contemplation and love of the Divinity, yet ceaſe not to be ſolicitous of things here below, or neglect the protection of Princes, Kingdomes and particular perſons; ſo likewiſe Heaven doth ſometimes produce certain ſublime wits endued with courage, addreſſe, and prudence enough to undertake ſuch en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counters, a thouſand other noble enterpriſes, beſides the conſervation of the State.

We have demonſtrated in the precedent year with how much juſtice the King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> entred <hi>Germany</hi> to defend the liberty of ſome Princes oppreſſed by the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> who were allied unto him, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to this Crown, and who were not only driven out of their Principalities, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo reduced to ſuch extremity that they knew not how to live. We have likewiſe ſeen, that he was the more readily induced to defend them in regard himſelf had received ſome injuries from the Emperour; particularly, when the Emperour cauſed his Letters ſent unto the Prince of <hi>Tranſilvania</hi> to be opened and falſly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted, when he ſent the Duke of <hi>Holſace</hi> with a great Army under his own Colours, to make War upon him in <hi>Pruſſe,</hi> when he confiſcated the Ships and Merchandiſes of the <hi>Swedes,</hi> formerly landed in the Towns of <hi>Germany,</hi> when he not only refuſed audience to his Embaſſadours, and denied them anſwer, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them upon pain of their lives preſently to depart the Empire; and when he refuſed by way of ſcorn, his proffer of Peace, in confidence of deſtroying him, not thinking him able to ſuſtain the force of his Arms. The Cardinal knew, that
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:56802:219"/>a Prince received no leſſe glory from defending his Allies, then from curbing the Ambition of his Neighbours, and therefore thought himſelf obliged to perſwade his Majeſty not to forſake the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> and Princes of <hi>Germany,</hi> in ſo impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant an occaſion. He knew no War was more lawfull then that which tends to the keeping of confederate Princes in their Dominions, and to revenge any injuries offered unto them: Hence it was, that having taken order for the intereſts of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Religion in <hi>Germany,</hi> he perſwaded his Majeſty to conclude and ſign the Treaty of Alliance with the King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> the conditions whereof, had been concluded about three or four moneths before. His Majeſty engaged to aſſiſt him with Men and Money, as he then did, and the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> expreſly engaged not to attempt any thing in prejudice of the Church in the Catholick Towns, of which he might poſſibly become Maſter; our invincible Monarch not thinking it enough to follow the generous ſentiments of his juſtice, which led him to ſecure thoſe Princes from oppreſſion, unleſſe accompanied with thoſe of his Piety; ſo he could not reſolve to aſſiſt an Heretick King, without precaution for the intereſt of the Church, that thoſe violences, which are the uſual effects of Arms, might not be attributed but to the diſorders which do neceſſarily follow the Camp.</p>

                  <p>THat War is juſt, ſaith <hi>St. Ambroſe,</hi> which is undertaken in defence of the weak or the Allies of a State againſt thoſe who oppreſſe them: <hi>St. Auguſtine</hi> teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us, that thoſe Arms are juſtifiable which are taken up to revenge injuries. The defence of Confederates, is one of thoſe actions which doth moſt of all ſet off a Kings glory, and raiſe it to the higheſt pitch of greatneſſe. Nothing doth more aſſimilate them to the Divinity, then the ſtretching out of their hands to ſupport the weak, the protecting of whom is an act well-beſeeming their Majeſties. He who never ought to divide his Crown to any one, ought however let his Arms be common to other Soveraigns for their defence.

If a King may with Juſtice defend the weak, and his confederates, doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe he may as juſtly imploy his power to revenge an injury. God who hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted the Scepter in the hand of Kings, hath alſo obliged them not to permit that the reſpect due to their Soveraign Majeſty be violated by any other Prince, as well as to maintain their Subjects within the bounds of their obedience.

                  <head>The Justice of the Kings Alliance with the King of <hi>Swede.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>THere is no doubt but the Alliance of the moſt chriſtian King with him of <hi>Swede,</hi> for the defence of their common confederates was very juſt, ſeeing the War it ſelf undertaken by the King of <hi>Swede</hi> was juſt, and that all Alliance contracted for the ſupport of a juſt War, is in it ſelf juſtifiable: Yet there was no device un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſſayed by the houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> to induce the World to condemn it. The firſt reaſon by them alledged in diſcredit thereof, was, that it was undertaken in the defence of Heretick Princes; but what reaſon was there, ſo long to have invaded the States of other Princes under the pretence of Religion? After <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth, had joyned the Imperial Crown to his Kingdomes of <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> with the Provinces of the Low-Countries; he thought that having forces enough to re-conquer all thoſe Countries, which formerly belonged to the Roman Emperour, he might with juſtice attempt it; as if Kingdomes were the diviſion of force, and as if birth and ſucceſſion of many ages were not bars enough to ſtop ambition. Now as <hi>Germany</hi> is the Bulwark which ſerves all he States of <hi>Europe</hi> to defend their liberty, as <hi>Henry</hi> the Second, King of <hi>France,</hi> writ unto the Princes of the Empire in the year, 1552. he reſolved to over-run it, concluding that having once maſtered it, he might with eaſe invade <hi>France, England,</hi> and the reſt of <hi>Italy.</hi> The Emperor who reigns at preſent knew as well how important it was, ſeeing in his letters ſent to <hi>Zuinga</hi> chief Counſellour to the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> he particularly nameth it the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the Authority of the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria. Germany</hi> indeed doth ſo abound in men and riches, that it is alone able to entertain Armies, and thoſe, great ones, for ever; nay, to ſupply the very <hi>Indies</hi> in caſe of a defect. This is the true ground of the War, and that which obliged the King of <hi>Swede</hi> to aſſiſt it, although the Spaniards pretence was, the rooting out of Hereſie. It is long ſince, the great <hi>St. Leon,</hi> writ to the Emperour <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> that men palliate their Paſſions with Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion: but much more reaſonably may it ſo be ſaid of the Auſtrian Princes (as <hi>Mariana</hi> hath well obſerved in his Hiſtory, that being it which makes ſo great an impreſſion upon the people. The World ſees by experience, how advantagious it was to them, when <hi>Ferdinand</hi> uſurped <hi>Navarre</hi> from his own Neece; they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves have ſeen, that it wanted but little of putting our Scepter into their hands, during the League. It is the beſt title by which they hold part of both the <hi>Indies,</hi> where they have put to death not only lawfull Princes, but at leaſt fifty Millions of people, with ſuch cruelty, that they have died the earth with blood, and made Heaven to groan with horrour, and well will they now make uſe of it to deſpoil the German Princes of their eſtates. But who is ignorant of their injuſtice, ſeeing that as the true Religion gives no right to Empires, ſo force cannot deprive him of it, to whom it falls by ſucceſion.</p>

                  <p>HEreſie doth no more diſ-ingage Subjects from obedience to their Prince than infidelity; but this being a point of Doctrine, peradventure ſome mean ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity will make a ſcruple to believe it, if only proved by the verity of politick maximes. I ſhall therefore back it by the belief which the Apoſtles-left in the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Church, which the Fathers taught in their Precepts and Examples, and which the ancient Chriſtians did moſt religiouſly obſerve amidſt their greateſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions.

                  <p>Now what reaſon can there be to blame alliances with Heretiques? Were it not to plead againſt their cuſtoms? And why ſhould they alone aſſume this Liberty, ſeeing they only object it to authorize their own ambitious Deſigns, and for our parts we only deſigne by it the preſervation of our Allies in the lawful poſſeſſion of their eſtates?

This one, was the weightieſt affair which hath a long time befallen the Church; and that alone conſideration were enough to vindicate the alliance with the <hi>Swede.</hi> If in proceſſe of time any diſorders have ſucceeded upon this Treaty, well may they be imputed unto the proſeperities, which had made a Prince become inſolent, but not unto the effects of his Majeſties alliance with him, who had no other deſigne beſides the eſtabliſhing of the German Princes. Religion was not intereſſed in the leaſt in the Articles of agreement, it having been expreſly conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded between them, that no alteration ſhould be made in any of thoſe places, of which his Arms ſhould make him Maſter. Thoſe diſorders which he committed againſt the Church were accidental, like unto thoſe medicines which weaken Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, yet cure the diſeaſe; in regard of which, no one ought to be deterr'd from aſſiſting his Allies: As the weakneſſe cauſed by Phyſick ought not to fright us from receiving it, becauſe ſtrength and health will the ſooner return after it.</p>
                  <p>The King hath already given ſatisfaction for ſome of thoſe injuries ſuffered by the German Church, and he will be glad to eſtabliſh the reſt, after the ambitious madneſſe of the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> ſhall be ſomwhat more reaſonable.

It is an errour to think Fortune is blind, becauſe ſhe diſtributeth her favours inconſiderately and without forecaſt; for that God himſelf whoſe eyes are clearer then the Sun, is the Author of whatever befalls man-kind. Well may ſhe be painted without eyes, when as ſhe doth uſually blind thoſe whom ſhe doth at any time oblige with the leaſt extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary ſucceſſe.

The deſire of Dominion which tranſporteth him, rendreth him careleſs of dying the earth with blood, if he may but ſubjugate more people to himſelf, and of making the world groan under the violence of his arms, if he may but get a new addition to his authority.

                  <p>PRinces though they are great, yet can they not negotiate their moſt important affairs, in their own perſons. Neceſſity compels them to imploy ſome of their Officers, and when they may negotiate in perſon any treaties with ſtrangers Prudence forbids them ſo to do; they ſhould not only be unworthy of that Mejeſty wherewith they are accompanied, by employing themſelves in the reſolution of a thouſand difficulties which they will meet with; but alſo, committing their autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to the conteſts which happen at all conferences; and what is moſt conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, is, that they have more liberty treating by their Embaſſadours to reject any Propoſitions diſ-agreeable unto them, without being obliged to declare their rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons: Withall, they have more time to weigh their reſolutions, either ratifying or rejecting them with their counſel, then when they are in publick Aſſemblies; they may likewiſe judge with more judgement, becauſe before the final concluſion they are informed of all the intentions of the contrary party, which their Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadours preſent at the Treaty, cannot but ſucceſſively diſcover, although they are obliged to reſolve on the Articles upon mature deliberation. Treaties of Peace are the more important, ſeeing in them is debated the reſtoring of the bond of human ſociety to States, the life of the Laws, Order, and Policy, and the plenty of all Proſperity, ſo that able perſons ought to be employed in them. The neceſſary qualities which he who is imployed on ſuch occaſions, ought to have, cannot be laid down in few words. I ſhall content my ſelf, to name ſome few which are the chiefeſt, and to ſay, that above all things he ought to have a perfect knowledge of the affair which he negotiates, as alſo of his Maſters intereſts, of theirs with whom he treats, and of their Allies, for otherwiſe he cannot avoid a ſurpriſal. Next to this chief quality, prudence ought to be as his eyes, to inform him what to reſolve, and what to evade, to fore-ſee the conſequences of thoſe propoſitions which are made, to countermine them who indeavour to blow him up to know how to chuſe means proper to obtain that end which his Maſter propoſeth, and to wave thoſe reaſons which are preſt upon him. This Prudence ought to be accompanied with a certain ſtayedneſſe which may prevent him from running into a raſh reſolution; he ought to be more phlegm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

He ought let others wrangle, without being moved from what he hath ſolidly reſolved, and to content himſelf with anſwering moderately ſuch objections as are made againſt him, without receding from thoſe fundamental propoſitions, upon which the main chance is to be decided. Irreſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution is a thing extreamly dangerous in him, not only becauſe it gives great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages to the oppoſite party, but becauſe it allays that vigour of ſpirit, with which his advice ought to be accompanied, and that earneſtneſſe which he ought to have for his Maſters ſervice; not that I would have his Prudence joined with ſo ſublime a ſubtilty, unleſſe he were indued with all thoſe extraordinary qualities which make a man eminent; for experience hath evinced unto us, that they who are only craf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, do commonly loſe themſelves in their own thoughts, and follow ſuch expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents which ſavour more of Chimera's and Apparencies, then Truth or Solidity. Such ruine affairs, by their Ambition to extract the quinteſſence of them, like thoſe who have a long time blowed to find the quinteſſence of Mettals, and in the end have nothing but wind for their pains. Secreſie is a quality the more need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in him, becauſe a deſign once diſcovered is of no more advantage them a Mine contramined, and that nakedneſſe doth as ill become his Soul as his Body; beſides,
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:56802:224"/>as no one can keep a ſecret without diſſimulation, he ought to have a Soul ſtrong enough, and wel adjuſted to diſguiſe his deſigns, &amp; to make ſhew to have other ends then thoſe which he doth pretend, though he ought not to make uſe of it unleſſe in matters of great importance, for the moſt part, behaving himſelf with great free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to beget the reputation of being ſincere, which will make his diſguiſements paſſe for the more currant truths, by reaſon he uſeth them ſo ſeldom. In fine, it were to be wiſhed that he were powerfull in diſcourſe, both for the well dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of his reaſons, as alſo to animate them with that vigour which is neceſſary to get approbation, and which might render them as effectual, as faintneſſe renders them uſeleſſe, when they are therewith accompanied.</p>

                  <p>THe Deputies were no ſooner arrived, but the conference began, yet not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till after the order of their ſitting had been concluded. It was reſolved that <hi>Panzirolo</hi> ſhould ſit at the end of the Table, which in <hi>Italy</hi> is eſteemed the moſt honourable place, the Baron of <hi>Galas</hi> on his left hand, the Marſhal <hi>de Thoyras</hi> on his right hand, the <hi>Sieur de Servient</hi> beneath <hi>Galas,</hi> the Preſident <hi>de Banies</hi> over againſt him, and the Chancellour <hi>Guichardy,</hi> at the lower end over againſt the <hi>Nuncio.</hi> At firſt indeed, and before the beginning of the Aſſembly, there was ſome difference upon this ſcore, becauſe the Baron <hi>de Galas,</hi> and the <hi>Comte de la Rocque,</hi> comming together to viſit the <hi>Sieur de Servient,</hi> the <hi>Comte de la Rocque</hi> took place of <hi>Galas;</hi> for afterwards the Marſhal <hi>de Thoyras,</hi> and the <hi>Sieur de Servient,</hi> did likewiſe pretend to take place of <hi>Galas,</hi> they being too much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd in their Maſers glory, to indure that his Majeſty ſhould ſuffer any diminu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which muſt have been, if repreſenting his perſon they ſhould have given place to him, of whom the Spaniſh Embaſſadour took place. The <hi>Comte de la Rocque</hi> would take this advantage of <hi>Galas,</hi> becauſe he was only qualified as a Comiſſary, pretending that Kings Embaſſadours took place of the Emperours Comiſſaries, though not of his Embaſſadours. In fine, it was adjudged, that for this once, the Spaniſh Embaſſadours ſhould give place to the Emperours Commiſſary, unleſſe <hi>Galas</hi> would likewiſe give place to the Moſt Chriſtian Kings Embaſſadours. To conclude, they went publickly through the Town, the <hi>Comte de la Rocque</hi> being in a Coach beneath <hi>Galas,</hi> and the <hi>Sieurs de Thoyras</hi> and <hi>Servient</hi> took place next af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him; their priorities being thus regulated they began to confer upon the means for executing the Treaty of Peace, concluded the precedent year at <hi>Ratisbone,</hi> in order to that which concern'd <hi>Italy;</hi> for as to the reſt, the Moſt Chriſtian King would never ratifie it, his Embaſſadours having gone beyond their Commiſſions. There were two chief cauſes of difficulty, the firſt, in regard of the eighteen thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Crowns rent, accorded to the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> in <hi>Montferrat,</hi> for which the Town of <hi>Trin</hi> was left him, and divers other Lands and ancient Demeſnes, which did amount to that ſum: The ſecond was, about the manner of reſtoring the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces both of <hi>Mantua</hi> and <hi>Montferrat,</hi> as alſo <hi>Savoy</hi> and <hi>Piedmont;</hi> the conteſts of either party were hot, and nothing concluded untill the 6 day of <hi>April,</hi> when it was reſolved that the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> ſhould content himſelf with fifteen thouſand crowns rent in <hi>Montferrat,</hi> valuing the Crown at eight Florins, in conſideration of the quality of thoſe Towns and Lands which were left unto him, which was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded by the Aſſembly; as concerning the reſtitution of places, it was concluded that the Forts newly built ſhould be demoliſhed, that each party ſhould withdraw his forces; and laſtly, that the places ſhould be reſtored at the ſame time, and that for aſſurance of the reſtitution, hoſtages ſhould interchangeably be given, and all to be conformable as much as could be unto the Treaty at <hi>Ratisbonne;</hi> neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, it being apprehended that thoſe of the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> would more readily ſacrifice three Hoſtages then relinquiſh the Griſons<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſeeing the poſſeſſion of them, would joyn their eſtates in <hi>Germany</hi> with thoſe of <hi>Millan;</hi> it was concluded by a ſecret Article, that the Towns of <hi>Suze</hi> and <hi>Avigliane,</hi> ſhould be delivered into the
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:56802:225"/>hands of the Swiſſes raiſed in the Cantons, allied with <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Savoy,</hi> to be by them kept in his Highneſſe of <hi>Savoy's</hi> name, untill ſuch time as the Forts and Paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges held by the <hi>Comte de Merodes</hi> in the Griſons were left free with obligation of reſtoring them to the Marſhal <hi>de Thoyras</hi> in caſe the ſaid Forts and Paſſages were not quitted: This general Treaty being concluded, there were particular indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours uſed to decide the differences between the King and Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> for the eſtabliſhment of an aſſured Peace between their Subjects. It was not long uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, becauſe there was nothing of difficulty in it, only the ſame conditions which had been agreed on the foregoing year. Theſe two Treaties being thus finiſhed, were ſigned to a general ſatisfaction of all, except <hi>Monſieur de Mantua,</hi> who was ſomething troubled to pay the charge, and the <hi>Comte de la Rocque,</hi> who would have continued on the War upon any conditions whatever; all the reſt, thinking that Peace was now reſtored unto <hi>Italy,</hi> which for three years laſt paſt, had been the Theatre of Sorrow.</p>

                  <p>THe Articles of the general Treaty, had been concluded with ſo much Prudence and Equity, that all thoſe whoſe intentions were juſt, could not but reſt abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly ſatisfied, though the Spaniards who only ſought an opportunity to embroil affairs, made the Emperour beleeve, that under that ſecret Article divers deſigns were compriſed; inſomuch that he writ to the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> ſomewhat diſconten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly, that <hi>Suze</hi> and <hi>Avigliane</hi> ſhould be put into the Swiſſe's power, and withall, refuſed to ratifie the Treaty of Peace, though it had been expreſly concluded in that of <hi>Ratisbonne,</hi> that any other way might be taken beſides that of Hoſtages, if the Deputies who negotiated the Affairs of <hi>Italy</hi> ſhould ſo think fit.

They likewiſe raiſed new Troops in <hi>Milan,</hi> as if they would not have any ignorant of their deſigns; and laſtly, they were extreamly urgent to force the Duke of <hi>Mantua</hi> to disband an inconſiderable number of French from <hi>Caſal</hi> and <hi>Mantua,</hi> whom he had deſired to be left there for the guard of thoſe places, and which were hardly able to ſecure them from a ſurprize, whereby he might be ſo diſabled, that they might with eaſe over-run his Country; which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo, and that no one can doubt of their Deſigne of re commencing the War the following year, what reaſon had his Majeſty to leave <hi>Italy</hi> without full aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of Peace and Liberty, by other means then that of a Treaty? Should he not have ſo done, he had thrown away his charges in vain, and the lives of ſo many French to no purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>This was it which obliged the King to require new aſſurances in the behalf of his Allies, and to inform the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> that he himſelf was in no greater aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance them others, conſidering how diſtruſtful the Spaniards were of him, and how much diſcontented with his late proceedings. On the other ſide, the Cardinal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented to his Majeſty, that Prudence obliged him not to abandon <hi>Italy</hi> in this danger, and that it was needful for him to uſe his power with the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> to obtain ſome one of his places, which might afford a free paſſage for his Armies into <hi>Italy,</hi> if occaſion ſhould draw them thither a third time. His Majeſty whoſe judgement is equally prudent as juſt, apprehended the importance of this advice, ſo that ſoon after he ſent Orders to the Sieur <hi>de Servient,</hi> who was yet with the
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:56802:226"/>Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> to deſire him to put <hi>Pignerol, Suze, Avigliane,</hi> or <hi>Savil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan</hi> into his Majeſties hands for ſome time, that he might keep the Spaniards in aw, and prevent them from making new attempts. This Propoſition indeed was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what ſtrange, but did not exaſperate him as it happened; for the Prudence which the <hi>Sieur de Servient</hi> uſed in that affair obtained his demands to his Majeſties glory and the liberty of the Italian Princes; he evinced unto the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> by ſo many demonſtrations, the deſigns which the Spaniards had to recommence the war, &amp; the juſt reaſon he in particular had to fear their growing powerful in <hi>Italy;</hi> which if once effected, all he could hope for was the favour of <hi>Cyclops,</hi> when he found himſelf obliged for the ſurety and defence of his eſtates. The <hi>Sieur de Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vient</hi> perceived that diſtruſt which is natural to Princes, made him loath to part with a place of importance, and to intruſt it in the hands of a ſtranger, but when he recollected to his memory that frankneſſe wherewith his Majeſty had ſo lately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored unto him the greateſt part of his Dominions, and the open profeſſion which he made of eſtabliſhing his glory, by the defence of his Allies, he at laſt brought him to reſolve upon the delivery of <hi>Pignerol</hi> untill ſuch time as the Spaniard ſhould make apparent that they intended to leave <hi>Italy</hi> in peace.

                  <p>PRinces actions are liable to divers interpretations, becauſe they are more ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turely conſidered then ordinary mens, and their drifts are more ſecret. This Treaty of the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> did ſet many heads on work, and divers apprehended it in terms quite different from the truth. He granted the City and Caſtle of <hi>Pig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerol</hi> to the King for ſix moneths only, and that for performance of his promiſe, to give him free paſſage through his State, and to aſſiſt him with Ammunition and Proviſion of all ſorts, as much and as often as need ſhould require, for defence of his Allies in <hi>Italy.</hi> However divers believed that he had abſolutely given this place to the King, and beſides, that it had been ſo concluded before ever the Marſhal <hi>de Thoyras,</hi> and the <hi>Sieur de Servient</hi> departed from <hi>Paris</hi> toward <hi>Queraſque.</hi> It was ſaid, that the <hi>Comte de Drouin</hi> had paſſed his word in <hi>January,</hi> and then aſſured his Majeſty that the place ſhould be delivered to him. But that being never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared they did rather gueſſe then know it, for knowledge is grounded upon rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons certain. All that can be ſaid, is that the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> did conſent to remit <hi>Pignerol</hi> abſolutely into his Majeſties hands, for the conſervation of the reſt of his eſtate; in ſo doing, he did very prudently, as we ſhall hereafter declare, had the King procured this advantage to his Crown, it had been but juſt to recover an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Demeaſne, which had been loſt by the condeſcention of his Predeceſſors, he had raiſed a Trophy to his glory, obtained by his Arms in <hi>Italy;</hi> he had conſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved part of that which did juſtly belong unto him by the Laws of War; it fine, he had ſecured all his Allies on the other ſide the Mountains, and curbed the Spaniſh Ambition. Theſe reaſons were ſo full of Juſtice, that the greateſt part of the world was perſwaded that the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> had abſolutely given <hi>Pignerol</hi> to the King; for what likelihood could there be that his Majeſty ſhould not retain ſome part of his Victories? That he ſhould expend at leaſt fifty millions in a War without reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſomewhat for recompence? That his Prudence ſhould not take ſome care for the preſervation of his Allies, after the experiment he had made of thoſe difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in the Paſſages? And that he ſhould leave the Spaniards in full power to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute their Uſurpations? There could not be any reaſon for it, and he muſt have renounced his juſt and lawfull pretenſions ſo to have done: On the other ſide, that which did moſt of all call in queſtion the truth of the Treaty, if indeed there were any thing was, that it was alwaies denied and diſſembled in the conferences, and kept as a ſecret till this preſent; nevertheleſſe this ſecret cannot be denied but to have been the effect of the Cardinal's Prudence, who well knoweth that the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt deſigns ought to be executed with the greateſt ſecrecy, and that counterfeit pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences cannot but be commendable, provided they be advantagious and free from injuſtice.</p>

                  <p>ALthough Diſſimulation is commonly eſteemed a vice amongſt private perſons yet it is ſo much the more needfull amongſt great Princes, in regard their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns ought to be kept more eſpecially ſecret. The diſcreeteſt Princes never look that way they deſign, and though they alwaies effect their thoughts, yet they ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome ſpeak what they think; they who apply themſelves to reading are more fit to entertain good company than for high enterprizes, ſeeing the Government of a State is a Stage upon which the Actors oftentimes ought to change their Masks and habits: They who can beſt of all cloak their deſigns are the moſt ingenious, and do oftneſt attain their ends; hence it is, that he who hath any thing to do with a crafty companion, hath work enough to look about him. Who knoweth not, that if all truth were neceſſarily to be told, nothing would remain unknown, which if ſo, the higheſt enterprizes would be ſucceſſeleſſe, it being moſt certain, that the diſcovery of an affair, is like an Alarum to ſummon together the ſtrongeſt oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions?
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:56802:227"/>It is allowable to keep that a ſecret which may be advantagious to our ſelves, or our friends, and cannot injure any one. It is great Prudence not to diſcourſe it with thoſe whom a man ſuſpects, and abſolutely to diſown it to all others. Thus <hi>Lewis</hi> the Moor, Duke of <hi>Millan,</hi> having made a Treaty with <hi>Charles</hi> the Eighth, to give him paſſage into <hi>Italy,</hi> and to favour his deſigns did conſtantly deny it to the King of <hi>Naples,</hi> the Pope, and <hi>Peter de Medicis,</hi> although the report of it was common, and ſome ſigns of it almoſt indubitable: Whereupon, he denying it ſo confidently, they remained a good while in ſuſpence, without knowing what to conclude. The denying of a deſign with aſſeveration, doth inſenſibly leave ſome doubt in the moſt determinate minds to believe it; and although the proteſtations made to the contrary do not gain an abſolute belief, yet do they commonly delay obſtructions which might be raiſed, and put off thoſe enterpriſes which would be ſet on foot to hinder them.</p>

This was that which forced the King to lay new Impoſitions upon his Subjects, which he did with the greater regret in regard he had formerly by the Cardinal's counſel, uſed ſome expedients to eaſe them; but neceſſity, whoſe Empire is more abſolute then that of Princes, forced his Majeſty to defer them, until ſuch time as his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs were ſetled in a ſure Peace; neither did the Chamber of Accompts make any ſcruple to confirm thoſe Edicts which did contribute thereunto when brought unto them, but it was not ſo with the <hi>Meſſieurs</hi> of the Court of <hi>Aydes</hi> of <hi>Paris. Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur le Comte</hi> having informed them that he was going to their Chamber from the King to do as much, they fell into ſuch diſorder that they all departed, thinking by this to diſengage themſelves from their duty of confirming them, ſo that, <hi>Monſieur de Compte</hi> comming thither found no body there.

                  <p>THere is no offence which Kings are more obliged to puniſh, then thoſe which are accompanied with diſ-reſpect; for as he who is much reſpected doth eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly retain his Subjects in their obedience, ſo being once fallen into diſeſteem his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands are little regarded. The wiſeſt Polititians have alwaies thought reſpect to be the greateſt ſupport of Authority. The luſtre of the Sun is that which cauſeth
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:56802:228"/>people to regard it with the more reverence; and the authority of a Soveraign is that which doth moſt of all oblige his ſubjects to pay him reſpect and obedience, which if violated by diſreſpect, remaineth inconſiderable; His Ordinances are laughed at, his Will not regarded, and attempts are often made againſt him. I think for my part, that ſcorn is more dangerous then hatred; for peradventure a King who is hated, may yet be feared, and fear is of it ſelf ſufficient to keep ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects in obedience; but he who is once fallen into diſ-eſteem, is neither hated nor feared; ſo that his affairs will ſoon fall into extream diſorder. Hatred is a frequent cauſe of Inſurrections, but diſ-reſpect is more effectually ſo, becauſe it not only cauſeth the fear of offending to ceaſe, but adds confidence to it. Now of all diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpects, none is more dangerous then when Magiſtrates are guilty of it, by with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing themſelves from their Princes Will and Command. No one will eaſily attempt againſt him whom he ſees honoured by his Magiſtrate; and on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, men will readily provoke him who is not regarded by them. Magiſtrates are the more obliged to continue their reſpects unto Authority, becauſe their example is ſufficient to hold the people in ſubmiſſion: They ought rather to comply obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently with their Soveraigns, then by denying him to ſhow an example of Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to his Subjects, their reſiſtance tends only to raiſe an irreparable diſorder in affairs, and obligeth the uſe of conſtraint for the ratifying of ſuch Edicts which preſently make the people believe them to be unjuſt. In fine, they are no leſs bound to render reſpect and obedience unto him, then juſtice to his Subiects. They flatter themſelves with a dangerous vanity, if they believe themſelves to have been inſtituted to bound in his power, ſeeing it was only to ſupply his preſence, and perform his will. All their power vaniſheth at his preſence, as that of the Stars when the Sun appeareth; neither ought they to take notice of his Commands, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then he gives them liberty. Now that liberty which he gives them, is by their humble Remonſtrances to repreſent their grievances, not abſolutely to deny, and that with diſreſpect, the execution of his commands; eſpecially ſeeing the cuſtome of confirming of Edicts was not introduced by neceſſity, or for any dependance which Kings have upon Soveraign Courts, but that they might be executed with more ſubmiſſion, and to diſcharge them from thoſe commands which the importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of Courtiers might wreſt from their Majeſties, without regard of Juſtice, or the good of the State.</p>

                  <p>DEfenſive Alliances cannot but be very uſeful to all Princes, how great ſoever. Few can ſubſiſt by themſelves, and if any alone be able to defend themſelves from their enemies, it cannot be without danger, and ſomtimes loſs to their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries; whereas if they unite themſelves with others that are powerful, no one will think of invading them. Though the Head be the nobleſt Members of the Body, yet it ſtandeth in need of thoſe others; and God who hath crowned the greateſt Monarchs, hath ſo eſtabliſhed them, that they have all occaſion to make uſe of one another. This may be ſaid in general of the advantage of Defenſive Allian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, but it is more particularly advantagious to have recourſe unto them, when a Neighbour Prince is ſo ſucceſſeful in Arms, that he begins to be terrible. On ſuch occaſions it is great prudence to contract alliances with thoſe which may joyn their Forces, as is uſual amongſt ſuch Princes whoſe Powers are indifferent, to follow the Fortune of the Conquerors, becauſe contracting an Alliance with ſuch, they not only augment their own Power, but weaken that of their enemy, and make him incapable of further miſchief.

<pb n="446" facs="tcp:56802:229"/>for ſecuring the French upon their Coaſts and ſafe paſſage into his Countries, which was preſently accorded; the ſubſtance of it was thus, that all French which ſhould enter into his Ports with his Moſt Chriſtian Majeſties Paſs, ſhould not in future be made ſlaves, nor be compelled to pay above the Tavaly or tenth of their goods, according to their uſual cuſtome; that for the better continuing their correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, Ambaſſadors ſhould be interchangeably ſent, and that all Religious perſons might live in the King of <hi>Morocco</hi>'s States, but on condition not to exerciſe their Functions, unleſs only to the French.

Commerce at Sea is that which hath made ſmall States very conſiderable, and great States vaſtly rich, and abounding with all ſorts of commodities: There is another reaſon which rendreth it the more important, and that is, Princes being bound to make themſelves powerful, as well by Sea as by Land, which double Power is the higheſt pitch of their greatneſs, for it renders them the more redoubted. It is in vain to drive a commerce by Sea, unleſs a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion of Ships be made to ſecure them, otherwiſe their riches will be expoſed as a prey to Pirats; and is Prince who maketh himſelf powerful on this Element, is the more feared by his Neighbours, in regard he may make his attempts upon them both by Sea and Land, in caſe they ſhould preſume to offend him. <hi>Coſmo de Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicis</hi> firſt Duke of <hi>Tuſcany,</hi> and the ableſt Politician of his time, ſaid, That a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign can never gain an high repute, unleſs he joyn both thoſe Powers together, which are to a State, as the Arms to the Body.

                  <p>AMongſt the divers Powers of Soveraigns, that of making Laws is one of the greateſt marks of their Authority. God entruſting them to diſpence Justice, hath not only appointed them to chaſtiſe the people, but likewiſe to make Laws and Statutes, which may ſerve for a Rule of their Government. Hence the Lawyers ſay, That Princes Will is Law. Democracy aſcribeth this power to the People; but Monarchy reſtraineth it to Kings only, and acknowledgeth no Laws but what are ſigned by their Majeſties. Now as the power of making Laws is in them, ſo is that of changing and adding, according as they ſhall think fit; if they had not this power, we ſhould have no other Laws then thoſe of Nature, imprinted in the heart of man by the meer inſtinct of reaſon, or ſuch as were made by the firſt Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Mankind. All the Volumns of <hi>Theodoſius</hi> and <hi>Juſtinian</hi> might be burnt, and thoſe of our Kings too, as ſo many attempts againſt the liberty of the people, becauſe they have been but of late Creation, there being none ſo ancient but what did once ſavour of Novelty. Were not this to put the people into an extream li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centiouſneſſe, and to ſhut our eyes againſt reaſon, which teacheth us, that the Kings of this age have no leſſe power then thoſe of old, who in their Laws have
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:56802:230"/>included what-ever they thought neceſſary, and which could not tye up their Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors hands from following their examples left unto them. It is a vulgar error, to imagine that to alter Laws muſt needs be dangerous: Without juſt conſideration indeed it ought not to be done, but when there happens any ſuch to be, the alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of them cannot but be advantagious; it being impoſſible that the firſt Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makers ſhould foreſee all inconveniences; which being ſo, their Succeſſors have power to change or abrogate them, as occaſion ſhall require. Abſolutely to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject Laws becauſe they are new, is but a Cynical humour, ſeeing the antiquity of them cannot be a juſt denyal to the uſe of ſeveral others which have ſince been or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained; neither can novelty be a ſufficient reaſon to impower thoſe which are at preſent in uſe. <hi>

                  <p>THoſe of the pretended reformed Religion had obtained permiſſion by the Kings Breviate about the beginning of this year, to make a National Aſſembly of their Miniſters of France, for the maintaining of their Order and Belief. The Cardinal was of opinion that his Majeſty ſhould require them to meet at <hi>Charenton,</hi> becauſe being within his view, they would have the leſſe Freedom to renew ſuch Cabal as
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:56802:231"/>they had formerly made in their Aſſemblies of <hi>Guyenne</hi> and <hi>Languedoc.</hi> This Order was followed, and the Sieur <hi>de Galland,</hi> Councellor to his Majeſty, was ſent to be Preſident in the King's behalf; his Loyalty was not to be ſuſpected, and they were obliged to accept of him, in regard of divers authentique teſtimonies which made appear, that this Order was conformable to that of Councels aſſembled in the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive times, which they profeſſed to honour. The King eſpecially commanded him to be careful that no Propoſition were made which did not concern their Faith or Diſcipline; to ſilence them in his Majeſty's name, in caſe they ſhould diſcourſe of any other affairs, and to eſtabliſh ſuch rules as the Cardinal had propoſed ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to keep that Sect in ſubmiſſion; To this end he uſed his utmoſt Prudence and Loyalty, he perſwaded them to enact, that there ſhould not any more National Aſſemblies be made, but in the preſence of a Commiſſary from the King, who might (by teſtifying their obedience) be a means of continuing them in quiet; beſides he induced them to reſolve upon the abſolute excluding of all ſtranger Miniſters, this being intended of all that were not natural French, and to inhibit their Miniſters from leaving the Kingdom without his Majeſty's licence, by this means to prevent all intelligences, aſſociations, and correſpondencies with the enemies of the State, according to the Laws of the Kingdom, and his Majeſty's particular prohibitions, in fine, he uſed ſo much prudence, that they required their Miniſters not to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meddle in any affairs Politique or Military; and condemned a Book of <hi>Berraut</hi> Miniſter of <hi>Montauban</hi> as erroneous, becauſe he maintained that Miniſters had a particular Call from God to bear Arms.

                  <p>ABout the end of this year the King could no longer endure that the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> ſhould abuſe his clemency in continuing to be the ſupporter of thoſe who troubled the Kingdom. They had choſen him for their <hi>Brave,</hi> and an Army of twelve or fifteen thouſand men, which he had raiſed about Spring, were the chief of their hopes, when <hi>Mounſieur</hi> went out of the Kingdom; they were ſo inconſiderate, as to believe that theſe Forces entring into <hi>France,</hi> would be like Rivers falling from great mountains, increaſe as they go; as if the King (aſſiſted by the ſage counſels of the Cardinal) were not able to ruine all their Souldiers up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their firſt taking the Field; It was however a great ſatisfaction to his Majeſty that he was not put to that trouble; the cauſe was either Fortune, or peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture the Cardinals prudence, which ſo wrought, that the Emperour finding him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf oppreſſed by the King of <hi>Swede,</hi> commanded the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> with his Army to aſſiſt him in his occaſions; ſo that leaving <hi>Monſieur</hi>'s affairs for ſome moneths, he addreſſed himſelf to attend the Emperour, and exerciſe the charge of Generalliſſimo of his Armies, but like the Grey-hound who running after two Hares, takes neither, he forſook <hi>Monſieur's</hi> aſſiſtance as he had promiſed; and inſtead of comming to the Randezvouz aſſigned by the Emperour 7000 of his men disbanded, and were ſcattered, whether by a Panick fear, or by ſome accident which ſo diſordered them, that it was impoſſible to rally them again. It was a ſenſible diſpleaſure to him to fall into this diſorder, after which he was forced to return to <hi>Nancy</hi> to take care of his promiſes made unto <hi>Monſieur,</hi> and to make a recruit, which the Emperour preſſed him to do. The Cardinal did not loſe ſo favourable an opportunity, to teach him that he did but wrong himſelf in provoking the King, as he had done for three or four years laſt paſt by fomenting of Cabals againſt his Majeſty. It was well known that he entertained <hi>Monſieur</hi> with turbulent hopes, not only of raiſing a potent Army in his Country; but withall, of bringing forces from <hi>Germany</hi> and the Low Countries, ſufficient to force the King himſelf to grant him his deſires. It was well known that he had exaſperated thoſe diviſions in the Kings Family, by particular intelligences which he maintained with ſeveral embroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers; that he had received Madam <hi>du Forgis</hi> with great honour, after her diſgrace as his chief correſpondent; that there was not any forraign Prince whom he did not indeavour to make an enemy to <hi>France,</hi> and if he did apprehend that any one of them were diſcontented, that he would with him hold a particular friendſhip, and all this without conſidering, that building without a foundation, his ſuperſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture would ſoon fall to the ground, and that his Majeſty would effect as many ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous enterprizes in his chaſtiſement as himſelf had conceived imaginary ſign<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

For the Governour was in hopes of relief which made him reſolve to hold out; he adviſed Collonel <hi>Offa</hi> the Emperours Commiſſary with the condition of the place, and the little hopes of long holding it, if not relieved; but he was anſwered, that it was to him a great aſtoniſhment that the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> who had promiſed the Emperour to relieve this place, ſhould be ſo careleſſe of it, that him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf was now upon return, and that to him he ought to redreſſe himſelf for relief. In concluſion, the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> was charged by the Emperour to defend it, after it had been fortifi'd at his charges, and that with ſuch paſſion, that it was obſerved he cauſed the money for payment of the workmen to be carried in his own Coach. He addreſſed himſelf to the Duke; but he fearing left the ſtorm he raiſed ſhould fall upon himſelf, durſt not openly aſſiſt them, but gave order to the Governour of <hi>Marſal</hi> to aſſiſt him with Men, Ammunitions, and Victuals, yet theſe ſuccours were too weak, is likewiſe the place, to reſiſt the Kings power; whereupon a parley followed, and conditions were agreed on for the ſurrendring of the place, if with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſix days an Army able to relieve it did not appear. No Army appeared, the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> wanting forces but not ill will.

                  <p>NO Prince whatever may uſurp without injuſtice, but for a mean Prince to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt it, reliſheth of meer imprudence.

Had this reſolution been frank and ſincere, the viſit had been commendable; but ſuch was his malice againſt his Majeſty, that thoſe things were the leaſt of his thoughts.

There need no other indicium to prove the letter to be his, then the bare reading of it: Not a perſon who had the honour to be near her Majeſty, could ever be perſwaded that it proceeded from her inclination, though ſigned with her hand, but that it was by the wicked inſinuations and devices of that ſeditious conſpirator, who in peace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing inconſiderable, would needs make himſelf famous and remarkable by raiſing war and troubles. He well knew how to work upon this great Princeſſes weakneſs, who being extreamly exaſperated againſt the Cardinal, would eaſily be perſwaded unto any thing which might diſadvantage him. Hereupon he made her believe, that this propitious Genius of <hi>France,</hi> was upon the point of breaking the Peace with <hi>Spain;</hi> That he had carried on the King to fall upon the Low Countries, and that in fine, the Spaniards and Emperours Forces would joyntly ſtrike into <hi>France,</hi> ſeize upon the Cities over-run the whole Champaigne country, pillage the Towns, rob the people, pull down the Churches; That Religion would be laid aſide, the Nobility ruined, The Royal Houſes errazed, and the French Nation expoſed unto death, or ſuch miſeries as were a terror to her very thoughts. This was the purport of the letter, and theſe were the conſiderations which obliged her to ſigne it. Strange it is to look upon the many diſguiſements tending to engage that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable company in a revolt, which hath ever been the main ſupport of this State, It was only deſired that they would oppoſe the Cardinal's deſignes, although all the enterpriſes wherein he ingaged the King, were indeed ſo many additions to his and the Kingdoms glory, as was apparent in the relief of <hi>Caſal,</hi> and Treaty of <hi>Pignerol.</hi> They were ſollicited to ruine this great Miniſter of State, whoſe pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent conduct was the chiefest ſword which his Majeſty employed in defence of his Kingdom, and whoſe every action did like a Thunderbolt, annihilate the ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous deſigns of the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria:</hi> But eſpecially were they wooed to induce his Majeſty to make a peace with <hi>Germany,</hi> though it was ſufficiently apparent, how that that concluded in the year 1622. had been the cauſe of all thoſe misfortunes whereunto our Allies have been expoſed; that relaxation having afforded oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity unto the Emperour, to take thoſe advantages which he obtained in the Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinate, and upon divers other Princes.</p>
                  <p>I cannot omit one ſtrange piece of Indiſcretion which <hi>Chanteloupe</hi> committed in this letter, <hi>viz.</hi> his overſight in letting the Queen-Mother publikely profeſs her

But the blame of this defect, as likewiſe of the whole Letter, was laid upon him as the true Author thereof, who had been ſo ſollicitous in procuring her to ſigne it, whoſe goodneſs (like that of the Sun) cannot do any hurt, unleſſe when in conjunction with ſome other Star of a malignant quality; Neither had the Parliament any regard thereunto, but reputed it as an aſperſion animated by the Spaniards, who then finding themſelves reduced to an exigency, were appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive of thoſe Forces which his Majeſty was diſpatching into <hi>Germany,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to look about them; when they ſaw the King imploying the courage of his Subjects in aſſiſting his Allies, and alſo a likelyhood of Breach between the two Crowns, whereunto indeed his Majeſty was invited by divers, although he would never be induced ſo to do, having alwaies thought it more glorious to preſerve Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of peace with integrity, then to conquer the Countries of his Neighbours.</p>

In vain it is to endeavour to perſwade them that it is needful to make war, or to carry that war into a Forraign Country, which is deſigned to be brought into our own; it were bootleſs to repreſent unto them, how the wiſeſt Kings have ever kept the War at a diſtance from their own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, and endeavoured to extinguiſh the fire in their Neighbours houſes, as know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their own to be the next in danger. It were but time and labour loſt, to offer unto their thoughts, that it is better to prevent a mortal ſickneſs when it threatneth a State, then to apply remedies juſt when the height of the diſeaſe threatneth a total ruine. To conclude, it is to no purpoſe to perſwade them that the peoples charge in maintaining an Army out of the Kingdom, is leſs then the inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of an Inteſtine War. The fruitfulneſs of a Country will afford the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants a ſufficient livelyhood, neither can want fall very heavie upon them, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding any Taxes, though great, impoſed upon them, in caſe they have freedom of commerce, and work.

There need no other allegation to prove this Truth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the People themſelves, who think it well enough if they may be free from Alarums, and the noiſe of Guns and Trumpets; whereas they deſpair if they

Theſe reaſons are ſo apparent, that one muſt either be prepoſſeſſed with Paſſion, or ſurprized by ſome ſiniſter advice, to imagine the contrary; and they are ſo much the more conſiderable for <hi>France,</hi> in regard the Emperour <hi>Charls</hi> the fifth diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing with <hi>Francis</hi> the firſt concerning the Natures of their Subjects, ſaid, That both French and Spaniard were naturally ſo inclin'd to murmur, that they would eaſily be led on to rebel againſt their Prince, if not diverted by ſome Forraign im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments.

One of the Crimes charged in the Duke of <hi>Alençon's</hi> Indictment, was his treating a Match between his Son and the Dut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſſe of <hi>York,</hi> an Engliſh Prince's daughter, without approbation from <hi>Charles</hi> the Seventh. The ſame <hi>Charles</hi> the Seventh, would not look upon his Son, <hi>Lewis</hi> the Eleventh, though of Age, for having treated a Match with <hi>Charlotte de Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy,</hi> without his knowledge, though it remained unconſummated until his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, firſt had and obtained.

                  <p>ALthough the <hi>Sieur de Puy-Laurens</hi> was very paſſionate for the concluding of <hi>Monſieur</hi>'s Marriage, yet (Princes Families: being often divided into facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons) the Preſident <hi>Coigneux</hi> was not ſo inclin'd; but on the contrary, took oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion in the t'others abſence, whileſt he was at <hi>Brixels</hi> negotiating with the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards for aid, to repreſent divers reaſons unto <hi>Monſieur</hi> to divert him from thoſe thoughts. He was not to learn, that in caſe <hi>Monſieur</hi> married the Princeſſee <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guerite,</hi> and the <hi>Sieur de Puy-Laurens</hi> the Princeſſe of <hi>Falsbourg,</hi> himſelf ſhould totally loſe that little credit and authority which he then had; he was apprehenſive of the aſcendency which a Woman hath over the ſoul of a Prince, when ſhe is once paſſionately beloved by him: Beſides, he was the more concern'd in that particular of the Princeſſe <hi>Marguerite,</hi> becauſe he conceived ſhe would be guided by the inſtinct and directions of the Princeſſe <hi>de Falsbourg,</hi> who would, in fine, rule all; laſtly, he doubted there was no way left to break off this match, which would be imputed as his fault; by reaſon of the place he held with <hi>Monſieur,</hi> ſo that there would be no hopes for him to be reſtored to the Kings favour, or the injoyment of his Goods and Offices. Theſe were the true motives and grounds which induced <hi>Coigneux</hi> to declare himſelf againſt the marriage, and to diſſwade <hi>Monſieur</hi> from any further progreſſe therein, although his advices were ſeconded with no other reaſons then the ſervice of his Highneſſe, and the good of his affairs. He one day took the boldneſſe to tell him, that he ought not to ſteer ſuch a courſe as would undoubtedly render the King irreconcilable unto him, ſeeing his greateſt glory and power was tied unto his Majeſties grace and favour, which this marriage would aſſuredly hazard, nay utterly deſtroy; he layed before him, how that though Princes are ſometimes excuſable, for doing ſuch acts in their heat and paſſion, which are diſpleaſing unto their Soveraign, yet they never ought to flie into ſuch extravagances as may totally ruine them in their Kings Favour. If may ſometimes

                  <p>AMongſt the divers Prerogatives of Princes, that of hindring marriages, is not of the leaſt importance. The right whereof may be proved from the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of ſome Canoniſts, whoſe reputations ſtand clear in the ſchools of all Divines<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and who affirm it in expreſſe terms. But not to quote their teſtimonies, me thinks we need no other proof to evince this truth, then common cuſtom. For were not the Emperours the firſt who determined the conditions and qualities of thoſe who might marry? Were not they the original inſtitutors of who might, and who might not marry? Hath not the Church extracted her decrees from their Laws? Beſides thoſe decrees of the Church, have not our Kings eftabliſhed new Orders, as is to be ſeen in the Ordinance of <hi>Blois,</hi> where <hi>Henry</hi> the Third declared all Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages void, wherein the Banes were not publiſhed, which however are not ſo ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged by the Church? And what hath given credit to the Decree of the Councel of <hi>Trent,</hi> but our Kings Declarations? Now if the validity depend upon their Seal, how can it be denied, but they likewiſe have authority to inforce this new prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition? And have they not likewiſe Ordained, notwithſtanding the Decree that Heretiques ſhould not be obliged to contract their Marriages in preſence of the Curate of the Pariſh where they live, which ceaſe not to be valid and in force? Beſides, is there not likewiſe another Ordinance, which impowered by our Kings only, and the cuſtom of <hi>Bretayn,</hi> which maketh the marriages of Guardians with their Pupils to be void, then not effected by the permiſſion of the Juſtice, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the Church is of another opinion? Theſe are reaſons which do evidently main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and prove, that our King<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

And indeed, what reaſon were there that they ſhould be denied this priviledge, ſeeing the whole power is principally conferred upon them, for the preſervation of the publique Peace and private Families, which depend exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly much, as is not unknown unto any one, upon marriages; which beſides, that it is ſo granted by the chief of Divines, is likewiſe deduceable from common expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience. Let not any one therefore make a queſtion of it. But if any one demand, in what manner they may hinder and obſtruct marriages, I ſhall make uſe of a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction in my anſwer, and ſay, that for the making of a general prohibition, it is requiſite to Ordain a publique and univerſal Law, to ſignifie their Will unto their Subjects, as was done in the Ordinance of <hi>Lewis</hi> the Eleventh, which inforced the publication of Banes. And in caſe of a particular marriage there need only a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular inhibition, to be ſignified unto the particular perſons, intending to contract themſelves, ſo that they be duly informed of the prohibition iſſued out againſt their further proceedings therein.</p>

This inclination of theirs did not much ſurpriſe him for that the Cardinal who is not ignorant of any thing, and whoſe Soul pierceth into the very depth of affairs, had cold him that he could expect no other overtures from them; yet his zeal for the Churches good ſo animated him, that he was very preſſing upon them, to imbrace the means neceſſary for a good accommodation: Indeed they ought to have duly conſidered thereof, ſeeing the League which uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them, was called Catholique, and two of them were Fecleſiaſtiques. But the firſt Article was the ſtumbling block of all, for they could not find in their hearts to withdraw themſelves from the Emperours Intereſts. The <hi>Sieur de Charnace,</hi> repreſented unto the Duke of <hi>Bavies,</hi> how that he profeſſing to imbrace the Churches intereſts, ought to prefer the preſervation thereof, both in his own and his Neighbour States, before all other conſiderations whatever, and that being now the thing in queſtion, he ought much ſooner to ſorſake the houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> then indanger the other. Notwithſtanding theſe reaſons, he could not find the leaſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination in him, ſo to do; but rather on the contrary, the Duke publiquely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, he could not conclude upon it, in regard of the great reaſon the Emperor would thereby have to complain againſt him, unto which he replied, that there was not any cauſe to apprehend the Emperours being diſcontented therewith, <hi>ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
                     <pb n="468" facs="tcp:56802:240"/>every Princes proper intereſt is to be preferr'd before all others whatever, and that the reſolving on this neutrality with the King of <hi>Swede,</hi> was the only viſible way to preſerve his State from a ruine, which elſe was unavoidable. However this diſcourſe though grounded upon reaſon and piety, could not prevail upon him. He ſaid as much unto the Elector of <hi>Cologne,</hi> unto whom he made his next addreſs from his Majeſty; neither here could he effect any thing conſiderable, ſo much were they diſpoſed to uphold the Intereſts of the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> before thoſe of the Church; as if they had not much regarded the beholding Gods houſes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moliſhed, Altars profaned, Sacred things plundered, Prieſts and Religious men de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoyled, provided they might not ſee the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> abaſed, or reduced to the neceſſity of being contented with thoſe States alone which did juſtry belong un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them. It was a bewitching blindneſs, not to be enough admired, that theſe two Electors (by embracing the Neutrality) might preſerve themſelves, their Religion and States, and yet would by refuſing it, expoſe all to aſſured ruine. But will not every one be more ſurprized with aſtoniſhment, when he ſhall underſtand, That they deſpiſing that accomodation which his Majeſty had mediated, ſhould in the end aſcribe all the calamities of the German Church unto his Majeſty's fault? As if he who furniſhed them with aſſured means to preſerve it, could be blamed for their non-acceptance, and ruining it: For my part, I muſt needs conclude them alone guilty of thoſe afflictions which befel both the Church and themſelves, for that he who refuſeth the means for obtaining any end, can complain againſt no one but himſelf, if he miſs of his Deſigne. In fin, they deſired a prolongation of the Treaty; the fifteen days being expired, that they might conſider on ſome other ways of Agreement. The King, that he might lay the whole fault at their own doors, as alſo that hee might not ſeem to decline any Propoſals tending to the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches good; diſpatched the Marquis <hi>de Breze</hi> a ſecond time into <hi>Germany,</hi> for that purpoſe. But the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> having laid before him how that there was not any more likely way then that of Neutrality, by them refuſed; and that delays, (which was but Truth) gave his Enemies opportunity to fortifie themſelves againſt him, he deſired to be excuſed: And thus their own wilful ſtubborneſs was the cauſe of his purſuing his conqueſts.</p>

Thus of evils, the leaſt is to be choſen; neither is the Pilot to be diſcommended, who that he may prevent an abſolute ſhipwrack, parteth with ſome of his Lading unto the Sea. Humane hopes are deceitful, ſo that it was the choice of a wiſe man, rather to ſecure himſelf from an evil, then to aſſure himſelf of an uncertain good; it often hapneth, That he who refuſeth an advantage offered unto him, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth to repent his non-acceptance thereof.

But it is not to be doubled that Catholique Princes are obliged to comply with a Victorious King, if their continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of the War may bring any detriment unto Religion; nor can any Alliance diſpence with this Law; The Pagans themſelves were ſo juſt in the obſervation thereof, that they never encroached upon it. And indeed, what reaſon can be

                  <p>ALthough Neutrality of it ſelf carrieth little aſſurance with it, it being frequently obſerved, that he who becomes Neuter, ſeeth his Country expoſed as a Prey unto the Conqueror; yet the caſe is much altered, when his Neutrality is counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanced by the protection of a great Monarch, who being his Neighbour, ſecureth him from all danger. I ſhould hardly adviſe a Petty Prince to put himſelf under the defence if a King far diſtant from him, becauſe in caſe of an Invaſion, his ſuccours cannot without difficulty arrive unto him; and if they come at all, it will be unſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably, and too late for his defence. Every one knoweth, that an Army in a long march diſbandeth of it ſelf, and thoſe few who hold out to the end, have more need to reſt then fight; Hence it is thoſe Protections our Kings have embraced in <hi>Italy,</hi> find ſuch ill ſucceſs. <hi>Lewis the</hi> XII. undertook the protection of <hi>John</hi> and <hi>Hannib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Bentivogli,</hi> who vere both thruſt out of <hi>Boulogne,</hi> when it was leaſt ſuſpected, neither was there any means to prevent it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Octavian Fregoſe</hi> put himſelf under the ſame protection, but all would not keep him in the Dutchy of <hi>Genoa. Piſa</hi> threw it ſelf into the hands of the French, but was deſerted, it being impoſſile to diſpatch Forces timely enough to defend it. Otherwiſe it is in the protection of a Prince living under the eye of a great Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch; nothing is ſo eaſie as his aſſiſtance, and ſuch a King is in honour bound to defend ſuch a Prince, with and againſt all men, that no inconveniency betide him. The Law of Protection obligeth him who craveth it, to pay all honour and reſpect unto his Defender, and that with ſuch ſubmiſſion, that in caſe he recede from his devoir, it may become lawful for his Protector to ſeize upon his State; and on the contrary, his Protector ought to undertake his defence, and ſecure him from the oppreſſion of any other whoſoever. That which rendereth the Protection of a Neighbour Monarch to be valid, and full of ſafety, doth moſt eſpecially conſiſt in the prudent Government of him who is protected, as when he doth wiſely obſerve and regard the Laws of Neutrality, which are neither to aſſiſt or provoke either party; in ſo managing his affairs, he giveth no occaſion of offence; and if the prevalent power attempt againſt him, his Injuſtice will appear the greater, becauſe a petty Prince is not obliged to declare himſelf, when his ruine is in danger. His Conduct indeed cannot pleaſe either party, neither can it reaſonably offend either; which if ſo, neither can with reaſon attempt againſt him: whereas if he declare himſelf againſt a great Prince lying on the skirts of his State, his utter deſtruction will be unavoidable.</p>

                  <p>THe Catholique Princes had no ſooner propoſed to become Neuters, but the Cardinal whoſe eyes are alwaies open to ſee and Judge of what is fit and proper for his maſters glory, adviſed his Majeſty to ſend a ſtrong army into <hi>Germany,</hi> to ſhew them that they might ſafely put themſelvs under his protection although he wanted not Forces who were already advanced unto the Borders of their Country, to ſecure them in a caſe of need, and to defend them from any violences which they might apprehend from the Emperonr, if the wheel of Fortune ſhould turn about. This Army conſiſted of about twenty four thouſand men, commanded joyntly by the Mareſchals <hi>de la Force, and d' Effiat.</hi> The Elector of <hi>Treves,</hi> adhering unto the Neutrality, under the Kings protection, it was thought requiſite for his greater ſecurity, that his Towns ſhould be delivered into his Majeſties power, for that the Imperialiſts hold all for enemies who do not countenance their ambitious Deſigns; and conſequently would force the reſt (as they had already done part of his Towns) out of his hands; which if they ſhould effect, what were it but to run upon one Rock, by endeavouring to avoid another He was ſoon perſwaded of the neceſity of this advice, which eaſily induced him to admit French Garriſons into his Cities.
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:56802:241"/>During theſe things, the Generals of the Army preſs'd him to conclude the Treaty, in order to his promiſes, which he ſeemed but coldly to receive, having already been aſſured from the Swediſh King, that for his Majeſty's ſake nothing ſhould be attempted againſt him, whileſt he was under his protection. They preſs'd him to be as good as his word telling him, it was diſhonourable for their Maſter to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him into his protection, and that others ſhould hold his Towns from him; whereupon he depoſited the Caſtle of <hi>Hermeſteine</hi> into their hands, a place conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable, both for its Form and Scituation, which is ſuch, that it may block up the River <hi>Rhine,</hi> at the foot whereof it is ſeated.

                  <p>AMongſt the moſt heroick actions of Kings, the defence of thoſe who deſire their protection, is one which addeth very much to their glory, and raiſeth their power to an eminent greatneſſe. Nothing doth more liken them unto the Divinity, then the defence of the weak and feeble; and if in petty Princes it be a mark of weakneſſe to follow the fortune of the Conquerour; it cannot but be a ſign of great power in a King, not to deny thoſe who ſue for his protection. The defending of them who requeſt it, is an act well beſeeroing the Majeſty of a King, who as he ought not to admit any Rival in his Crown, ſo ought he not to deny the communicating of his power unto them who flie unto him for refuge. This is it which maketh a King Arbitrator of all his Neighbours affairs, who gladly ſubmit their differences unto the judgement of a Monarch, who imployeth his power for the maintaining of Juſtice. No one can be ignorant how this is it which rendreth
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:56802:242"/>them invincible, it being moſt certain, that who ſo lendeth a hand to help his friends in their neceſſities, ingageth ſo many ſerveral defendors, whenever his oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cſions ſhall require it. To be able to ſubſiſt alone, without the help of others is very honoursble for a King, yet his glory will be imperfect, if he do not imploy his power to redreſſe his oppreſſed Neighbours in their neceſſities. Tyranny doth build its greatneſſe on the uſurpations of others rights, whereas Juſtice foundeth her glory on the defending the oppreſſed. And if a King may at any time ſend his forces abroad out of his own State, it ought to be either in preſervation of his Allies, under his protection, or in revenge of injuries offered unto him.</p>

                  <p>THe League between the <hi>Swede</hi> and <hi>France</hi> together with the Elector of <hi>Treves</hi> inclination made ſuch an Alarum in the houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> now unable to divert the ſtorm hanging over them, that they reſolved to have recourſe unto <hi>Rome,</hi> and there to repreſent the Churches grievances in ſuch terms, that they might receive the ſame advantages which the Spaniards heretofore did, upon the like pretences. The Cardinal <hi>Paſman</hi> was diſpatched thither, in order thereunto, where being come, he uſed is utmoſt endeavours to ingage the Pope in their affaris; his Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe was preſs'd to make a Croiſade for preſervation of the German Catholicks, for the ſuppreſſing of Hereſie, and eſtabliſhing the Church in its former ſplendor. There were divers calumnies publiſhed abroad againſt the Swedes, the diſaſters of the Church, and miſeries of the Catholicks were aggravated unto exceſſe, but not a word to be heard, how that the Intereſts of the Church had not been in queſtion, but by their unjuſt ſupporting the ambitious deſigns of the Auſtrian family. He indeavoured to perſwade the Pope, that the King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> like another <hi>Attila,</hi> had reſolved to beſiege <hi>Rome,</hi> and force his Holineſſe from his Seat, but eſpecially was he charged to declaim againſt the Alliance between the <hi>Swede</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> and to ſolicite his Holineſs to ſend a Legate or extraordinary <hi>Nuncio,</hi> to break the knot as prejudicial to the Catholick church. The Duke <hi>de Savelly,</hi> his Imperial Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties Embaſſadour, and the Spaniſh Embaſſadour had order to ſecond him: Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal <hi>Borgia</hi> newly tied unto the Spaniſh party, by the gift of the Arch-Biſhoprick of <hi>Sevill,</hi> did not only underhand indeavour to procure the ſuffrages of particular Cardinals, but in the open conſiſtory did violently exclaim, in blaming the Pope for abandoning the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> and in it, the Church it ſelf, highly exalting the King of <hi>Spain's</hi> zeal for Religion, and crying out againſt the cold rewarding his good intentions.</p>
                  <p>Now divers of the Conſiſtory, being unacquainted with the affairs of <hi>Germany,</hi> and how the misfortunes befallen on ſome Catholique Princes, was the only effect of their own faults, were at firſt divided, and the Spaniſh Partiſans became ſo ſtout, that his Hoſineſſe had juſt cauſe to diſlike their proceedings.

                  <p>IT was not without great reaſon, what <hi>Antonio Peres</hi> once told the late <hi>Henry</hi> the Great, <hi>viz.</hi> that the French being unmatchable for courage, would undoubtedly conquer the whole earth, if to their natural valour, the favour of <hi>Rome,</hi> the maſtery of the Sea, and a fix'd Council of able Stateſmen were adjoyned: Theſe three things make a Prince truly great: And the courſe of affairs now leadeth me to diſcourſe of one of them, <hi>viz</hi> of the neceſſity of holding a fair correſpondence with the Roman Sea, which I may well ſay is neceſſary, partly for the avoiding of thoſe evils which may happen by want thereof and partly for the inducing the people by its approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to admit of the many and ſeveral undertakings in a State. The Empire of Souls, is both great and tickleth, if it were only in relation of thoſe Anathemas which may be darted out againſt Princes. One of the moſt conſpicuous church-lights, ſaid, and that with great judgement, that the Thunders of the Church are to be feared, how unjuſt ſoever; and indeed ſo they are, becauſe the execrations of Chriſt Jeſus Vicar, are of great efficacy before God, who holdeth the Government of Kingdomes in his hands, and alſo becauſe of the terrours they ſtrike into the people, who concluding a Prince reproved by God, as ſoon as by the Holy Sea, do not only loſe their reſpect, due to ſuch rulers, but even run into diſobedience and inſurrection. Did not thoſe Thunders in the times of the late League, kindle the flames, which did long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume this Kingdom, what was it which brought <hi>Navar</hi> into the Spaniards hands, but the imbroils between <hi>Lewis</hi> the Twelfth and <hi>Julius</hi> the Second? Now if a good intelligence with the Sea of <hi>Rome,</hi> is ſecurity from ſuch like misfortunes; it is no leſſe an advantage to a State, in regard of its approbation of a Soveraigns enterpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zes, This is it which holdeth the people in quiet, which maketh them think the yoak of obedience to be eaſie, which preſerveth the love of their Prince in their minds; and which rendreth contributions impoſed by neceſſity, the more ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; and in general it may be ſaid, that there is not any thing how bad ſoever, which they will diſtaſt, if approved by the Holy Sea, ſo great a reſpect doth Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion produce in the minds of men. King <hi>Numa</hi> had no better invention to make his actions received by the people of <hi>Rome,</hi> then by telling them, he did nothing but by the Counſel of the Nymph <hi>Egeria,</hi> who communicated the Will of the Gods unto him. No one is ignorant of the repute which the South-ſayers had with the people of <hi>Rome,</hi> in perſwading them to approve of their Conſuls and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours deſigns and undertakings. Could then any more likely way be invented,

Was it probable that the whole Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Friers would relinquiſh the priviledges they had obtained from the holy See? On the other ſide, What reaſon was there that the Prelats ſhould have ſo little au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority over them in Adminiſtration of Sacraments, and the Word of God, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Primitive times Friers were only mix'd amongſt the Laity, and addreſſed themſelves unto the Biſhops Congregations to receive the Sacraments from their hands<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or thoſe who executed their charge? No one but the Cardinal could give an end to theſe differences, there being not a man who durſt ſo much as make a a Propoſal whereby each party might receive ſatisfaction: neither did he wave the trouble, but willingly took it upon himſelf, though he was even at that time im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in the moſt important affairs of Chriſtendom; yet ſuch was his indefatiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble zeal for God's glory, and the Churches good, that he undertook the buſineſs. He cauſe the Superiors of the Orders to come before him, one by one, well know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that to negotiate ſuch a buſineſs in a Publike Aſſembly, would be a labour in vain, and equally difficult as the breaking of a cable, whoſe particular threads are eaſily to be forced aſunder. He was a perſon well vers'd in all Antiquities, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly he repreſented to them, how that in the firſt Inſtitution of Monks, they were conſecrated unto God by the mediation of Biſhops, who received their Vows, inſtructed them, and directed their Conſciences: He laid before them the original of the whole Affair,, and ſhewed them, how that the Sons of God had ſubjected all thoſe who ſold their goods, and followed him, unto the Apoſtles, whoſe Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors the Biſhops are; whereupon they making a ſtrict profeſſion of leading an Evangelical life, were more particularly obliged to obſerve the order eſtabliſhed in and by the Goſpel; not that he would queſtion the validity of thoſe exemptions
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:56802:244"/>granted from the holy See, unto which he owed much more reſpect and obedience then to debate the Ordinances thereof, yet that he muſt needs inform them, that they could not be diſpenſed with from following the order eſtabliſhed by Jeſus Chriſt, or his Apoſtles, in adminiſtring the Sacraments and Word of God; That it was not alwaies proper to uſe the utmoſt of a mans power and that the wiſeſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are uſually the moſt moderate; that in fine, themſelves could not deny but they were obliged to relinquiſh ſome part of their pretenſions, for the avoyding of trouble to the Church, which was likely to enſue upon this account, and whereof the Heretiques diſcourſed with much freedom and joy; That this Peace would be more acceptable to God, then all the advantages it could otherwiſe procure unto particular perſons; That it would tend unto their Honours, by teſtifying unto the world the moderations of their minds, and humility of their Spirits<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the two wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy ornaments of a Religious perſon, and that conſequently the world would eſteem the better of them; That he hoped it would be the more acceptable before God, in regard they did exemplarily ſet forth the merit of obedience and ſubmiſſion to their Prelats in ordinary, unto whom God hath with his own mouth committed the leading of men unto charitable works; that he ſhould not willingly propoſe, that the Biſhops ſhould have ordinary juriſdiction over their perſons, or power to viſit their Monaſteries, but that leaving them full liberty to execute their Monaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal functions, it ſeemed fit unto him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that they ſhould not refuſe to be dependent upon them in matter of adminiſtring the Sacraments, of Thankſ-giving, Penitence, Preaching the Word, and to admit them to have power to repeal this priviledge which was derived from them, according as the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> hath preſcribed, all whoſe Decrees are true, and ought to be obſerved. Theſe Reaſons were or themſelves ſtrong enough, but much more powerful, when animated by the charms of his diſcourſe, which hath ſo great an influence, that it is impoſſible to deny him any thing, if all they who have had the honour to know him, may be credited. Accordingly each one addreſſed himſelf to obſerve his directions; and although ſome unreaſonable perſons began at firſt to create ſome difficulties yet his Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence ſoon prevailed over them, inſomuch that they could not be thought the ſame men, who had ſo lately and ſo ſtifly maintained their abſolute Independencies upon their Ordinaries. He cauſed a Declaration to be drawn, wherein they acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged themſelves uncapable to preach without examination, licence, and approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from their Biſhops firſt had and obtained, and that the ſaid Biſhops might at any time revoke the ſaid Licenſes; withal, that they neither ought nor could bear the Confeſſions of Secular men, without approbation, which the ſaid Biſhops might likewiſe repeal, in caſe of any incapacity, or publike ſcandal. Every one ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed thereunto. The Biſhops diſpatched Copies thereof into all parts; and thus his Eminency ended a difference which had made ſuch a noiſe ſo many Ages toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and in which there was but little hopes.</p>

                  <head>The danger of Drawing Strangers into a Kingdom.</head>
                  <p>IT is very dangerous to call ſtrangers into a State, in hopes to ſupport a revolt by their means. No doubt they will be ready to foment any diſcontent, and to incourage any attempt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but it is wiſdom to miſtruſt them. Is it not a mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to hope for men and miracles from a Prince who hath enough to do to defend himſelf? If there be any Libertines uncapable of civil ſociety, any diſorder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly irreligious perſons, any Plunderers, ſuch as take all they meet, theſe are the men with whom they ſhall be furniſhed; Now were it not (I pray) a folly to build hopes and deſigns upon men ſo qualified? To ſay the truth, ſuch men as they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not affectionately ingage themſelves, ſo will they not readily endanger themſelves, but behave themſelves moſt couragiouſly in rifling and robbing naked and poor people, until they come to fight, and then nothing is ſo pittiful and backward. Now if it be weakneſs to truſt in ſtrange Souldiers, it is more folly to confide in their Commanders, who if perſons of no courage, what reaſonable expectations can be hoped from them? And if they be perſons well qualified, and fit to command, there is then more cauſe to fear then truſt them, for doubtleſs they will hardly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake any Hold they once take in a Country, but will do their utmoſt to ſurprize ſome place of Importance; which if it be not ſuddenly to be effected, yet certainly they will deſigne it, and bring it to paſs, when opportunity inviteth them. The <hi>Carthaginians</hi> (according as <hi>Polybius</hi> relateth) ſaw their affairs run from bad to worſe, when their Army became full of Strangers, Gauls, Spaniards, Greeks and Fugitives, and <hi>Tacitus</hi> tells us the true cauſe, why Armies compos'd of Strangers ſubſiſt no longer then Fortune ſmileth upon them, but disband upon the leaſt blow or loſs, becauſe they want affection. Th' Emperour of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> having call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ten thouſand Turks unto his aſſiſtance, ſoon perceived his own folly; becauſe they finding themſelves the ſtrongeſt party, would not return back again, but laid the foundation of thoſe miſeries under which they now hold that Empire. But that we go no further then <hi>France</hi> it ſelf, which hath more indangered it, then the calling in of the Engliſh and Spaniards; and doth not every one know, that when Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Wars have opened the Gates of a Kingdom unto Strangers, they ſoon fortifie themſelves ſo ſtrongly, that they are hardly to be removed, but after long and ſad Wars? It is great prudence in a Prince, not to engage in any revolt, but if he be ſo ill

I inſert this criminal in the Catalogue of great men, not in regard of his birth or the ſervices he hath done the State; but in conſideration of the imployment wherewith his Majeſty was pleas'd to honour him, which was more to avoid the Queen-Mothers importunities, then for any reward of his deſerts, which could hardly have invited his Majeſty to raiſe him unto
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:56802:246"/>ſo eminent a degree. Indeed the whole Court was aſtouiſh'd to ſee the King ad<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>vance him to that dignity, openly ſaying, that the extortions he had uſed in his im<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ploiments were his moſt remarkable actions, they accuſed his courage, nor could they diſſemble their opinions, that ſuch honours were not uſed to be conlerr'd on perſons of his temper. The late King, <hi>H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

Running at the Ring war then much in faſhion, where his diligence got him more credit then any fight he had ever ſeen. The firſt command he had was under <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur de Angouleſm,</hi> were he was Commiſſary of the Victuals, which he diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged ſo untowardly, that the King had then puniſhed him upon divers complaints made againſt him, but that the Cardinal interpoſed in his behalf. The building of the Cittadel of <hi>Verdun</hi> was the next thing intruſted to his care, but he preſently fell to make ſuch exactions upon poor mens labours, that ſome particulars thereof al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready proved, beſides what is yet in diſpute are prodigious. The Garriſon being once eſtabliſhed, he robb'd the Souldiers, as much as the Builders; and being Liev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant of the Country, he went on to that height, that he exacted from the Villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, whatever was neceſſary to be ſpent in his houſe, divers Towns payed him year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly compoſitions, raiſed by compact, that they might prevent the quartering of his Souldiers; others agreed to provide neceſſaries for his houſe, which however, for the moſt part, were delivered but once in kind, and then altered into ſums of ready mony. If any Town made the leaſt reſiſtance or grumbling, the inhabitants were ſure to be ruin'd and plundered by his Souldiers, who knew they ſhould not be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to account for it, but rather that they ſhould be countenanced for it, by him who ſet them on work. This trade did he drive, and that ſo publickly over all the extent of his power, as if the King himſelf had approved thereof; neither was there want of any proof to make evident at his Tryal. In the year 1627. he was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed at <hi>Rochel,</hi> where the credit he got was ſo little to his advantage, that the Commander <hi>de Valance,</hi> who calleth every thing by its right name, talking one day unto the King of a man without courage, openly ſaid, that he was no more a coward then <hi>Marillac.</hi> About that very time was it, that he indeavoured by his Letters, and the deſigns of thoſe of his Cabal, to ſow the Seeds of diſcontent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Queen-Mother and the Cardinal, which have proved ſo unhappy to the whole Kingdom; and he continued to foment that fire with ſuch care and addreſſe that the ſparks of it are not yet quite extinguiſhed. During the Kings abode in <hi>Italy,</hi> the Cardinal to pleaſe the Queen-Mother, procured the command of the Army in <hi>Campagne,</hi> to be conferred upon him, where he robb'd the Souldiers of their very bread with ſuch boldneſſe, that he ſometimes exacted a third, frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a quarter, but never miſs'd a fifth; and when he was commanded with his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces into <hi>Italy,</hi> he delayed the time with excuſes, either that he might croſſe the Kings deſigns (which they of his Cabal much deſired) or becauſe he would not divide that command with another, on t'other ſide the Mountains, which himſelf injoyed alone in <hi>Campagne;</hi> inſomuch, that his Majeſties affairs had fallen into extream diſorder, had it not been for the Prudent Conduct of the Cardinal and Generals who commanded the Army in <hi>Italy.</hi> Succeeding Ages will hardly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that ſuch exceſſes were put up ſo long together, eſpecially if they compare it with preceding times, where the Marſhal <hi>de Gie,</hi> deſcended from one of the beſt houſes of the Kingdom, and a perſon intruſted with great imployments under three ſeveral Kings, where the Admiral <hi>Chabot,</hi> one of the moſt valiant of thoſe times, and one who governed the State with <hi>Anne de Montmorency,</hi> where the Marſhal <hi>de Biez,</hi> the Chancellour <hi>Poiet, Jean de Montaign, Grand Maiſtre de France, Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter des Eſſart<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>THe Oppreſſion of the poor, is a crime which reacheth high as heaven, and crieth for revenge unto God.

His kindred ſolicited for him, as often, as many, and with what liberty they pleaſed. They uſed their utmoſt indeavours to ingage the Judges to ſave his life, nay they threatned them, partly by recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations, partly by menaces, ſent from perſons abroad, the moſt potent that could be intereſſed in his protection. The diſcuſſing of the Informations, Interrogato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and Pleas by him uſed to ſave his life, too up two moneths times in the Court. All the Commiſſaries were perfectly inſtructed of every proceeding, it being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted them, to deliver the full and ample extract of all his charge and defence, unto thoſe who ſolicited in his behalf. He was ſo favourably dealt withall, that one of the Commiſſaries, who had drawn up the information, was not received as Judge,
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:56802:247"/>nor divers others againſt whom he excepted, at which the King was not a little of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended. It was permitted that one of the Judges who pleaded unto his fellow Brethren, nothing but reaſons of lenity, and all arguments which might induce them to acquit him, was admitted to ſit as Judge, though by the ſtrictneſſe of law he might have been excluded. The King himſelf proceeded with ſo much Clemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, that there was not any one appeared on his behalf, to ſolicite his condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but on the contrary, his Majeſty called all the Judges before him, and that he might give them free liberty to act, told them, he expected no other Juſtice from them, but ſuch as they would willingly ſhew unto his meaneſt ſubject. To be ſhort, before they proceeded to judgement, he was twice demanded after the lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt Interrogatories that ever were heard (it having laſted three whole days) if he had any thing to ſay for himſelf, unto which he anſwered, no. Here was as much favour and lenity ſhewed, as poſſibly could have been deſired, towards a perſon deſigned to be ſaved. But what likelihood was there to defend him, from the penalty of the Ordinance in 46. ratified in Parliament, which declareth, that whoever purloineth the Treaſure, ſhall be puniſhed by confiſcation of Body and Goods? Upon what accompt could he be exempted from the penalty of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance <hi>de Blois,</hi> which commandeth that all the Heads and Members of Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, found to have exacted monies to avoid quartering in Houſes or Villages, ſhall be puniſhed with death, without hopes of pardon, with this additional clauſe, that though his Majeſty ſhould by his favour, or the importunity of others, be induced to pardon it, yet the Lord Keeper is prohibited to Seal it, and the Judges required not to regard it? Could the Judges poſſibly have eluded that Law, which tieth up the Kings very Mercy? Moreover, what could they find in the Priſones, or his Crimes, which could invite them to favour him, who had not made himſelf con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable in any his imploiment, wherewith the King had honour'd him, but by the extortions he had impoſed on the people? Are not all Magiſtrates bound to imploy their utmoſt care, in defence of the poor, who have no relief but Juſtice? Whereas his Robberies, accompanied with ſuch, endleſſe impoſitions, made him worthy of death, and did they not likewiſe oblige his Judges to be the more ſevere towards him? The State could not receive any loſſe by his death, who had never done any remarkable ſervice for his King or Country; but who on the contrary, was the chief inſtrument to perſwade <hi>Monſieur</hi> to come into the Kingdom with his Sword in his hand. Could it with reaſon have been expected that the Cardinal whoſe ſervices are indeed conſiderable enough to obtain his Majeſties pardon for any offendor, ſhould uſe his power with the King to beg his pardon, who had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented and peradventure propoſed to deſtroy him, at leaſt promiſed his aſſiſting hand in ſo execrable an action? Can it be denied, but that after ſuch ſtrong and weighty reaſons, it had been injuſtice to afford him any favour! Whereupon, twelve of his Judges, conforming their opinions to the rigours of the Law, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged him worthy of death, declaring him attained and convicted of purloining the Treaſure, or publick extortion, exactions, falſities, counterfeits, cheats, over-charging and oppreſſing the Kings Subjects.

This was a diſeaſe not to be ſuffered to grow any older, yet the cure of it had been almoſt deſperate to any other but the King; for <hi>Calais</hi> as it is far removed from <hi>Paris,</hi> ſo is it likewiſe more diſtant from <hi>Lorrain.</hi> But his Majeſty, whoſe vigilance doth oftentimes give him great Victories, did eaſily en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure the troubles of the Journey. He knew from his cradle it was not without great reaſon that an Emperour deſigning to repreſent upon the Reverſe of a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dail, the means which the Roman Republique had uſed in conquering the Univerſe, contrived a <hi>Rome</hi> with wings upon its feet and hands; intimating, that Vigilance had made her Miſtreſs of the world: In order whereunto, he never apprehended any embroyl elther within or without the Kingdom, which he did not readily en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter in his own perſon, upon the leaſt aſſurance that he might take them unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provided, who had contrived any thing againſt his State or perſon, and thereby overcome them with leſs trouble, and more eaſe.</p>
                  <p>The King departed then from Saint <hi>Germain</hi> about the beginning of <hi>May,</hi> and not long after came to <hi>Calais,</hi> where being arrived, he placed ſix Companies of the Regiment of <hi>Navarre</hi> in the Cittadel, commanded the Sieur <hi>de Va<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>GOd having conſtituted Kings as the Images of his Power, doth no leſs require them to puniſh any injuries committed againſt their Majeſty, then the crimes of their Subjects. To what other end is it that they have the ſword of Juſtice in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted with them, unleſs it be as an aſſured teſtimony of the power they have to Right themſelves for any injuries? He who hath ſo little courage as to paſs them by, will ſoon become the object of his Neighbours ſcorn, every one will trample on him, and God himſelf being offended at his little care in preſerving thoſe ſtamps of his Majeſty which he hath imprinted on his Forehead, will juſtly permit him to be deſpoyled of that honour which he had beſtowed upon him. God hath unto private men given no other means to repel the injuries offered unto them, then the Juſtice of their Soveraigns, whom he hath commanded to right them; but other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe it is with Kings, unto them he hath given power to puniſh thoſe who offend them, be they of what quality ſoever. There is not a man above them who can arbitrate their differences, themſelves are the only Judges of their own Rights, and they may lawfully take up Arms both when and as often as their Prudence and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice ſhall think fit. The <hi>Primum Mobile</hi> hath no dependence on any other Orb in point of his motion; and Kings (thoſe primary cauſes of a State) have no ſuperiour authority over them, to direct them in point of War. It is ſufficient that they againſt whom they take up Arms, have given them cauſe ſo to do. Hence it is that one of the eminent'ſt lights of the Church calleth that War juſt, which is undertaken to revenge injuries: And <hi>Archidamus</hi> in <hi>Thucydides</hi> ſaith, Every War is juſt, which is made to revenge any groundleſs injury. Now amongſt all the things which may provoke a Prince to take up Arms, that of raiſing Forces to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade his Kingdom, of violating Treaties, and recommencing old Quarrels, are moſt juſtifiable. The Rules of Politique Juſtice do not only permit a War as law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, againſt them who come and beſiege Towns, and commit diſorders in another State; no, they are not bound to ſit ſtill in expectation of that ſtorm, but it ſufficeth to have only known &amp; diſcovered their deſigns and malicious intentions: for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe it were a very great imprudence, the ableſt Commanders having ever con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded it better to carry a war into his Country who deſigneth to invade, then to expect him in our own; In fine, The Breach of Treaties and Promiſes hath alwaies been accounted highly injurious unto Princes. Gentlemen have their throats cut for breach of word, and Princes may not put it up, if it be of never ſo little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment, without making war upon it, With the Spaniards indeed it is prover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bial, <hi>Wind carries Words and Feathers.</hi> The wiſeſt Politicians do tell us, That to promiſe in a Treaty what is not intended to be performed, is to ſcorn a Prince, and <hi>Homer</hi> ſaith, He who promiſeth one thing, and intendeth another, ought to be reputed for an Enemy.</p>

To make ſhort, he came to Saint <hi>Monehouſt</hi> the 15. of <hi>June,</hi> ready to fall with his Army upon the Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> in caſe he offered to ſtir a foot, or ſend and Forces with <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur</hi> into <hi>France,</hi> but he was better adviſed, as it fell out, then ſo to do. The Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſchal <hi>d' Effiat</hi> without more loſs of time, preſented his Army before <hi>Pont-a Mouſſon,</hi> which ſo terrified the Inhabitants, that they opened their Garet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reſiſtance: The Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> was no leſs aſtoniſhed, and now beginning to foreſee his ruine, deſired a meeting with the Mareſchal <hi>d' Effiat;</hi> where he accuſed <hi>Monſieur's</hi> arrival at <hi>Nancy,</hi> proteſting it was not by his procurement, and telling him he would give his Majeſty any ſatisfaction or aſſurance of his fidelity. The Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſchal acquainted his Majeſty therewith, who thought it not beſt to pardon him a ſecond time, without ſome kind of revenge, eſpecially ſeeing there was no truſt to be given to his promiſes, after ſo manifeſt a diſcovery of his malice and deſigns againſt <hi>France;</hi> whereupon he drew up to <hi>Vaubecourt,</hi> to enter upon <hi>Lorrain.</hi> In the mean time having Intelligence brought, that a Regiment of the Duke's Horſe, commanded by the Sieur <hi>de Lenoncourt,</hi> was not far from <hi>Rouuray,</hi> that he might teach him to be another time more wary, he commanded the <hi>Comte d' Alets</hi> to draw out ſix hundred Horſe, his own Muſquettiers, thirty of the Cardinals Guard, two hundred Musquettiers of the Regiment <hi>des Gardes,</hi> all mounted upon ſmall Naggs, and to go charge them; which was effected accordingly, with ſuch cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and ſucceſs, that two hundred and fifty were left dead on the place, many wounded and taken, beſides five Cornets, and ſtore of Horſes which afforded the Foot opportunity to march more to their eaſe. The King's loſs was not great, there being only ſeven killed, and ſome few hurt, amongſt whom the Duke <hi>d' Hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin,</hi> Commander of the light Horſe, and the Sieur <hi>de Bouchavennes</hi> received two Piſtol ſhots in their Arms. The Sieur <hi>de Calabre</hi> was at that time about two leagues diſtant, raiſing a Troop of Dragoons for the Duke's ſervice, but he was hindred by thirty of the King's light horſe, and as many of the Mareſchal at <hi>Schomberg,</hi> who by his Majeſty's order charged them ſo home, and ſo ſuddenly, that they had not leiſure to make any defence, but were all brought away Priſoners. The King in the interim advanced into <hi>Lorrain,</hi> and took divers places one after another. <hi>Bar le Duc</hi> ſurrendred upon the firſt ſummons, Saint <hi>Mihel</hi> did the like, into which place his Majeſty entred in Tryumph, accompanyed by the Priſoners of <hi>Rounray,</hi> and his whole Army, to the great aſtoniſhment of the Inhabitants, who were not uſed to behold ſo great a Power. He ordained the Sieur <hi>De Neſmond</hi> to take the place of Juſtice in the Seat of the Soveraigne Counſel of <hi>Lorrain</hi> in this City; and finding the Officers refuſing to take the Oath of Allegiance, he prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited them to exerciſe their Offices, and appointed others in their ſtead; hereby ſhewing unto the Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> that his ruine was inevitable, as often as he durſt attempt any thing againſt <hi>France,</hi> or recede from his devoir. In earneſt, I know not unto what that little Prince may be compared more fitly, then unto the earth, which may well fill the Ayr with exhalations, and ſomtimes over-caſt the Sun with clouds, from which not long after proceed Thunders and Hail, to deſtroy what-ever ſhe hath of beauty, and to reduce her richeſt Harveſts unto nothing.

                  <p>NO War is juſt but that which is neceſſary, according to the opinion of the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt Politicians: So that a Prince never ought to undertake it, but upon juſt conſiderations. War is know to be the ſource of all misfortunes, it filleth a State
<pb n="488" facs="tcp:56802:250"/>with impieties, violences; extortions, and cruelties, it deſtroyeth the innocent, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodateth the rich, and pulleth away the bread out of the hands of the poor, what reaſon therefore to commence it, unleſſe upon good ground, and when ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity doth even inforce it ? Now of all Princes which fail of their deſigns in point of War none are more juſtly puniſhed for their temerity, then thoſe who build de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns diſproportionable to their powers; ſuch Princes are eaſily reduced either to a neceſſity of ſeeing their Army cut in pieces, or of making a Peace upon diſhonou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable conditions. Perhaps they fancy an augmentation of credit power, and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; but in concluſion, they are driven to exigencies and confuſions, which had never befallen them, bad they but prudently remembred that the Creator of the Univerſe hath ſet bounds to all Empires; that he had before our births pre-ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, what condition we ſhould here injoy; that our lives and our fortunes are both limited, and that notwithſtanding all our care, all our indeavours, we cannot in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe the one, or protract the t'other one tittle, unleſſe Heaven concur to favour our attempts: They find by experience, that the moſt active and buſie drive on their ends more ſlowly then other men; that thoſe men whoſe minds are taken up with continual broyls, do often fall into the ſnare they had contrived for others; and that thoſe Princes who think to be moſt wiſe and ſubtle in deceiving others, are commonly themſelves miſtaken and deluded. To conclude, they who are truly wiſe, do foreſee at a diſtance what the iſſue of their attempts may be, and do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the management of affairs unto their Judgement, without following the impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſneſs of their emotions; they know, that who ſo is maſter of his paſſions, is maſter of his Fortune; and they imitate <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s Prudence, who never took the Field, until he had taken care for four things which ſeem to be the true foundation of Victory.</p>
                  <p>The firſt whereof is, To be fully inform'd of an Enemies Force, of his Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages, and of his Wants, before he encounter with him.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond is, To have an Army in readineſs, if poſſible, before he hear of it.</p>
                  <p>The third is, To have all Proviſions both of Ammunition and Victuals in a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs.</p>
                  <p>And the fourth is, To have all ſorts of Inſtruments and Warlike Engines at Command.</p>
                  <p>Theſe were the things which gave <hi>Caeſar</hi> the opportunity to proſecute his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts with ſucceſs, and to bring great exploits to perfection, in a very ſmall time.

The Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> was forced to confeſs as much, though againſt his Will, both in conſideration of the defeat of his Forces, and loſs of his Towns: In fine, he was neceſſitated to ſend the Sieur <hi>de Courtriſſon</hi> to offer all ſort of ſatisfaction unto his Majeſty. The King amidſt the greateſt Victories, was ever wont to prefer peace before war; yet becauſe Infidelities are a juſt cauſe of diſtruſt, he could not believe that the Duke had any cordial intention to conclude the war, his Word and Actions being diſconſonant: Whereupon be Proceeded on Wedneſday <hi>June</hi> 23. to inveſt <hi>Nancy,</hi> and accordingly he came with his Army two days after unto <hi>Liverdun,</hi> which is only two Leagues diſtant from it, and ſent an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other part of his Army within half a league from it. The Duke well perceived
<pb n="489" facs="tcp:56802:250"/>that the King was reſolved in good earneſt to chaſtiſe him for all his ill deſigns a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>France,</hi> and finding himſelf preſs'd by the near approaches of the Army, ſent the Sieur <hi>de Ville,</hi> chief Gentleman of his Bed-chamber, and <hi>Janin;</hi> Secretary of State, once more to offer him all manner of content, giving them likewiſe full li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to treat. They teſtified unto his Majeſty, that their Maſter was very much afflicted for having inconſiderately ſuffered himſelf to be ingaged with <hi>Monſieur,</hi> They proteſted that in future he would continue immovable in his Devoir; That he would pay him the Fealty and Homage due for the Dutchy of <hi>Bar;</hi> That he would inviolably adhere to the Intereſts of <hi>France,</hi> particularly offering to joyn his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces with his, to be employed in any expedition whatever; and withal, that he would depoſite part of his Towns in his Majeſty's hands, as a gage of his perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. The King received them very curteouſly, knowing it to be more glorious to receive the ſubmiſſions of his Enemies, confeſſing themſelves vanquiſhed, then to deſtroy them, deſpoil them, and inſult upon them; and then, as if he would ſet no bounds to his clemency, he promiſed to pardon him a ſecond time, and that he would not be againſt any accomodation that reaſonably could be deſired, provided there might be any aſſurance of his promiſes. But it being requiſite to find out ſome other kind of ſecurity for performance of his engagement, then what had formerly been, whereby he might be deprived of the means of running any more into his former deſigns, his Majeſty remitted them to the Cardinal to conclude the Articles of the Treaty.</p>

                  <p>ALthough all Princes have power and riches more then enough, wherewithal to be contented, yet ſome there are, who purſuing their ambitious Inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; ſooner then the Laws of Prudence, do daylie engage themſelves in new De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns. They ſeem to divert their eyes from what they poſſeſs, covetouſly to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold what they have not; and to quit the true and ſolid goods of peace, that they may obtain an uncertain vain-glory in War.

                  <p>VVHat good ſucceſſe might there not be expected from this Treaty, when the Cardinal had the management of it? His courage and conduct had already extended the bounds of <hi>France,</hi> raiſed ſeveral Trophies to the King's glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and acquired new Lawrels to his Majeſty; wherefore it was not to be doubted, but that he would a ſecond time let the Lorrainers know, that his Maſter doth as well inherit the courage as the Crowns of his Predeceſſors, who have ever forced
<pb n="490" facs="tcp:56802:251"/>their Anceſtors to ſtoop under their Arms, in deſpite of the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> the Supporters of their hopes, not their State; and that there was no concluſion to be made with him, without extraordinary pledges for performance of their promiſes. To this end tended his very firſt diſcourſe, that he might preſently cut off their hopes of ſurprizing him, and deſtroy their deſigns of getting clear for a few fair words, or proteſtations of fidelity. Two cauſes there were which inclined the Deputies to receive the Law from him; Firſt, An unavoydable neceſſity either of accommodation, or of ruine to their Maſter's affairs: And ſecondly, That in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard it was to be doubted<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that in caſe theſe effects did not oblige him, he would reſolve, notwithſtanding all the misfortunes arrived upon him, to re-commence the War upon the firſt fair opportunity of time or hopes, wherewith the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> entertained him. This latter was ſo improbable, that it could hardly ſink into the Cardinal's thoughts; yet becauſe he ſomwhat ſuſpected it, he made it his main deſigne in this Treaty to obtain ſuch advantages for the King, that it ſhould be altogether impoſſible for the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> to engage himſelf in a third War, without his utter ruine. The meeting was at <hi>Liverdun,</hi> where after divers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſts, it was at length concluded, That the Duke ſhould deliver the Town and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle of <hi>Stenay</hi> within ſix days, and within three days after the Town and Caſtle of <hi>Jamets,</hi> with the Arms, Ammunitions, and Victuals therein unto his Majeſty, for four years times, as gages of his fidelity, upon condition that the ſaid time being expired, the ſaid places ſhould be reſtored, in the ſame condition they then were: That during the ſaid term of time, it ſhould be lawful for the King to put into them what number of men he pleaſed; That the Inhabitants take the Oath of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance unto his Majeſty, and ſwear, not to attempt any thing contrary to his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. That the Duke ſhould within three days ſurrender into the King's hands, the City and Fortreſs of <hi>Clermont<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> which his Majeſty pretended to belong unto him, by Proceſs of the Parliament of <hi>Paris,</hi> who had adjudged his Majeſty to have the poſſeſſion thereof, paying to the ſaid Duke ſuch a ſum of money as ſhould be agreed on by Commiſſioners from both parties, in recompence of the Revenue he received from thence. That the Duke ſhould be obliged to render homage and fealty for <hi>Barr.</hi> within one year, unto the King. And as touching all differences moved, or which hereafter ſhould be moved between them, that there ſhould be Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of either ſide appointed to ſit at <hi>Paris,</hi> when-ever it ſhould pleaſe his Majeſty to think fit, to make a fair end between them. It was likewiſe concluded, that the Duke ſhould religiouſly obſerve and keep the five firſt Articles of the Treaty of <hi>Vic,</hi> which ſhould be confirmed without any exception what ever: That be ſhould faithfully adhere unto his Majeſties Intereſts: That he ſhould joyn his Forces with his Majeſties, and aſſiſt him to his utmoſt in any War what-ever: That his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties Forces ſhould have free paſſage through his Country: In conſideration where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, the Cardinal undertook in his Majeſty's behalf, to ſurrender the City and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle of <hi>Bar</hi> unto the Duke, as alſo the City and Caſtle of Saint <hi>Mihel, Pont-a-Mouſſon,</hi> and generally what-ever his Majeſty had taken from him, to with-draw his Forces from <hi>Lorrain,</hi> and to protect the Perſon and Eſtates of the ſaid Duke againſt all perſons without exception. The Cardinal perſwaded his Majeſty to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm theſe conditions, which could not be well miſliked, they being advantagious for the glory of <hi>France,</hi> and leaving his Majeſty at full liberty to go and chaſtiſe them, who abuſing <hi>Monſieurs</hi> name, had ſet the Kingdom in an uproar.

In concluſion, his Majeſty returned into <hi>France,</hi> and ſo to <hi>Paris,</hi> chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing rather to follow the inſtigations of his goodneſs, then of diſtruſt, which he had however cauſe to return.</p>

                  <p>IT is ever more commendable in a Prince to exceed rather in credulity then jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie, eſpecially if it be not to his diſadvantage: whereas on the other ſide, Diſtruſt is praiſe-worthy in Treaties with a perſon not to be credited, and where an eaſie Belief may breed inconveniences. It is equally bad<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to believe no man, and to believe every man; and as it is prudence not to truſt a man whom there is cauſe to ſuſpect<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo it is a ſigne of courage, not to fear where there is no cauſe of diſtruſt. It ſomtimes hapneth, that confidence breaketh the courage of an enemy, reduceth him to his devoir, and forceth him to relinquiſh his Deſigns: For as diſtruſt doth extreamly much diſ-oblige the trueſt friends, ſo confidence hath ſuch charms, that it is able to captivate the moſt mortal enemies.

                  <p>WE have before declared how the King being juſt upon his March into <hi>Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain, Monſieur</hi> paſs'd by with his Forces; The ſight of his Majeſty's For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces hindred him from making any great ſtay, as alſo from carrying the Duke of <hi>Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain's</hi> Troops along with him, which he intended, and was a thing very neceſſary, in order to his deſigns, becauſe the buſineſs in <hi>Languedoc</hi> was not yet ſo forward as was expected. From <hi>Lorrain</hi> he went into <hi>Baſſigny,</hi> and quartered at <hi>Andelot</hi> on the 13 of <hi>June,</hi> where they who abuſed his favour, and made uſe of his Name, publiſhed the moſt ſeditious Libel that was ever yet heard; it was fraught with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite proteſtations of doing his Majeſty ſervice, their uſual pretexts who imbroyl the State: As if to trouble the whole Kingdom, to beſiege Towns and Cities, to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs his Subjects, to ſeize on the money belonging to the Exchequer, to engage the Nobility in a Revolt, were to do his Majeſty ſervice, and all this expreſly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his Majeſty's command and inhibition. Were not theſe Proteſtations a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious veyl, wherewith <hi>Monſieurs</hi> followers endeavoured to hide the impatiency of their ſpirits;, when they ſaw thoſe predictions which foretold the King's death above two years before come to nothing upon which they built all the hopes of their advancements? That indeed was the true cauſe which induced them to ſpread thoſe libellous calumnies againſt the Cardinal, with ſuch abſurd exaggerations, that they made them incredible; ſo true it is, that ſlanders of exceſs, and contrary to any probable appearance, make but ſmall impreſſions upon them who are maſters but of never ſo little reaſon. Indeed who could well believe him to be a diſturber of
<pb n="492" facs="tcp:56802:252"/>the Publike peace, an enemy to the King and Royal Family, as they publiſhed in their Manifeſt, who in fifteen days time procured by his prudent conduct, ſo many glories for <hi>France</hi> and his Majeſty in <hi>Lorrain?</hi> What probability was there to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade the world that he would make himſelf Maſter of the State, as they endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to convince unto <hi>Monſieur,</hi> who had uſed ſuch great induſtry to cauſe his return into <hi>France,</hi> when he firſt left the Kingdom, and who never ſtirred towards <hi>Piedmont,</hi> until his return was certainly concluded? And in the end, he forced them to diſ-own that imputation, by his perſwading the King to ſhew him ſo much clemency, and ſuch extraordinary magnificence, to oblige him to a ſecond return. What reaſon could they then have to take up Arms upon his accompt? They had not any the leaſt juſt ground for it, which is evident to all the world; neither were all their ſlanders able to ſully his glory in any particular what-ever: But rather on the contrary, as Musk and Civet acquire a pleaſant and delightful ſmell amidſt the dunghil and Ordure, by the ſame Anti-periſtaſis that fire is hotteſt in the coldeſt of Winter; ſo all their ſlanders proclaimed againſt him, ſerv'd only to increaſe the ſweet odour of his Reputation, which his Services and Qualities (more then hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane) had acquired unto him: That I may ſay ſomthing touching his own particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar reſentment, it is moſt certain, his ſoul was more affected with compaſſion for <hi>France<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                  <p>IT cannot but be an unjuſt reward, to repay the ſervices of a grand Miniſter with calumnies. If good offices do by all kinds of Juſtice oblige a grateful return, what reaſon can there then be, injuriouſly to attaint his honour, who imployeth his whole time in his Countries good? It is faith an Ancient, a great mans miſery, when he ſeeth himſelf appayed with ſlanders; yet notwithſtanding, the moſt famous men of Antiquity, and thoſe very perſons from whom our Kings have received moſt ſignal ſervices, have found themſelves ingratefully rewarded. Let us a little look back into the beginning of this Monarchy, and take a view of thoſe who have ſerved our Kings, hardly ſhall we find any one whoſe conduct hath not been blamed, accuſed condemned. We have hereof laid down the reaſons in other places; at preſent I ſhall inſert this only, That the Favour of their Maſter the Benefits they receive from Him, and the Glory which they obtain by their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, are a ſufficient cauſe to procure them hatred; ſo great an Empire hath Envy in the Courts of Princes. Not that this misfortune is only appropriate to this Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy; No, it is of longer ſtanding, and more univerſal: For did not the Atheni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans baniſh <hi>Themiſtocles,</hi> the greateſt man of his time, and one who had done them unſpeakable ſervice? Was not <hi>Coriolanus</hi> hated, accuſed, baniſhed by the Romans, whom nothing but meer neceſſity could reduce to a ſenſe of their fault? And how often did the Iſraelites rebel againſt <hi>Moſes,</hi> who had how-ever done ſo many mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles before their eyes? A thouſand other examples might be produced, were the univerſality hereof a thing queſtionable.

All their attempts ſerved only to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inforce his diligence, that he might ſtifle the fire in its firſt eruption, which was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to burn the whole Kingdom. <hi>Monſieur</hi> was marched into <hi>France,</hi> with about two thouſand Horſe, Liegeois, Walloons, and Germans, commanded by the <hi>Sieur Meternie Canon</hi> of <hi>Treves,</hi> and <hi>des Granges</hi> of <hi>Liege;</hi> at firſt he fell in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Bourgogne,</hi> becauſe <hi>Monſieur de Montmorency</hi>'s Letters, acquainted him, how the affairs of <hi>Languedoc</hi> were not yet ripe for his ſervice, which made him reſolve to ſpend ſome time there. Being advanced within four or five Leagues of <hi>Dijon,</hi> he writ unto the Mayor and Sheriffs, as alſo unto the Parliament, to induce them to favour his ſtay, and to furniſh him with means for his Armies ſubſiſtance, thinking with himſelf, that in caſe they ſhould condiſcend thereunto, he might quickly find ſome way or other to get himſelf into the City, and become Maſter thereof. But as it fell out, they were not inclined to give him that content; ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, on the contrary, having received his Letters, with great reſpect, they ſent them all unto the King, and beſeeched his Highneſſe that he would approve of their proceedings herein, to the intent that receiving his Majeſties directions, they might follow his inſtructions in that particular. In the mean time, they raiſed the whole City, and mounted their Canon, in caſe need ſhould require. Whereupon a Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of <hi>Monſieurs</hi> Horſe, comming up to fire the <hi>Fauxbourg</hi> Saint <hi>Nicholas;</hi> the great ſhot gave them ſo hot a welcome, that they were forced to retire with the loſſe of about twenty men, whom they leſt upon the place, amongſt whom was a certain Captain, a Liegeois, much eſteemed by <hi>Monſieur,</hi> who departed the next morning. <hi>Monſieurs</hi> Forces were ſo netled at this diſaſter, that they reſolved to be revenged. In concluſion, they committed ſuch diſorders, that moſt part of the adjacent Villages were burned, being firſt of all plundered. But it was not the backwardneſſe of <hi>Dijon</hi> which forced him to leave that Country, the Marſhal <hi>de la Force,</hi> who followed him at hand, was the chief cauſe of his removal from thoſe parts: For as ſoon as ever the King underſtood of <hi>Mouſieur's</hi> march into <hi>France,</hi> knowing no time ought to be loſt, in preventing a Revolt, and that delays may afford ſuch perſons opportunity to raiſe Forces, and ſeize upon ſtrong places; he commanded the Marſhal <hi>de la Force,</hi> to take with him about ten thouſand foot and two thouſand horſe of the <hi>Lorrain</hi> forces, and to attend upon his motions, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent any further inconveniency, ſo that the Treaty of <hi>Liverdun</hi> being once con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, <hi>Monſieur</hi> had but little time of reſt in that Country. His Majeſty likewiſe thought fit to ſend the Marſhal <hi>de Schomberg</hi> upon the ſame deſign, with fifteen hundred <hi>Maiſtros, Genſdarmes,</hi> and Light-horſe, as alſo nine hundred Musque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers mounted, which himſelf choſe out of the Regiment of his Guard; ſo that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting theſe two in his Rear, he was forced to march with the more ſpeed. His

                  <p>IT is great Prudence, not to neglect or ſlight the ſmalleſt Revolts, but to cut them off in the firſt growth. Some are ſo fatally blind, as to perſwade themſelves, that having great Forces a ſmall Army can hardly get any advantage upon them. But the wiſeſt men have learnt from Reaſon and Experience, that mean begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, have ſometimes had dangerous ends, and that inſurrections, are like Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, which the further they run, the more they increaſe their Channels, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large their Banks. They are not ignorant of the inſtability of humane affairs, and that of all others the chances of War are moſt incertain. They know, that to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regard an enemy, giveth him a great advantage, for that he is thereby permitted to raiſe Forces, and to fortifie himſelf; ſo that in concluſion, it will be as hard a task to ſubdue him, as at firſt it would have been eaſie to have prevented him from making the leaſt progreſs in his deſign. One of the <hi>Pharaohs</hi> of <hi>Egypt</hi> was ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderate, as to ſlight the Caldeans, being thereunto perſwaded by ſome emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent men of <hi>Tunis,</hi> who told him, that for a Prince of his birth, deſcended from a ſtem of ancient Kings, Lord of a large Country, and eſteemed by every one, as the Arbitrator of War and Peace; to fear ſo inconſiderable an enemy, would be injurious and diſhonourable to him; but he was not long unpayed, for the Calde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans invaded his Country, aſſaulted his Cities, and ruin'd his Kingdom, they mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with no oppoſition at all. The ſmall eſteem which thoſe of <hi>Ninive</hi> made of their Beſiegers, and the great confidence they put in their own Walls and Power, were the cauſes of their being taken in the middeſt of their mirth. There need no more but one ſmall ſparkle to kindle a great Fire, and but a ſmall Revolt to over-run a whole Kingdom, if there be not ſome preventive Force uſed. Do we not ſee how the greateſt Storms, begin with a little Gale of Wind; and that the greateſt darkneſſes are Uſhered in by ſmall Clouds; ſo do we likewiſe often ſee, the greateſt Wars to grow from little beginnings. A State is ſeldome without, I think, I may ſafely ſay never, ſome diſcontented perſons, who would be very glad to joyn their forces, with thoſe of any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volted Prince, if they could have but a ſmall opportunity: And ſome, indeed, too too many Ranſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

The ſureſt remedy in ſuch caſes, is, to prevent them betimes, and to wait up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the firſt appearers in the field, with ſuch power and force, that they may not have time to know where they are, and that others may not dare to ſtir a foot to joyn with them.</p>

                  <p>THe Duke of <hi>Montmorency,</hi> was the man who had ingaged <hi>Monſieur</hi> to come into <hi>Languedoc,</hi> giving him to hope for great aſſiſtance in thoſe parts, and that himſelf had credit and power enough to arm all that Province in his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half. He had been much diſcontented from the year, 1629. when the <hi>Eſleus</hi> were eſtabliſhed of ſuch concern, was the Creation of thoſe new Officers unto him; for they were then impowered to impoſe the Contributions upon the people which formerly belonged unto the States, and eſpecially the Governour. Who ſometimes would exact a hundred thouſand Livres for his own ſhare, which loſſe he could ill brook, by reaſon he was uſed to make great expences: It is true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, the <hi>Sieur de Emery,</hi> Intendent of the Treaſuries, being ſent into <hi>Langue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doc</hi> to execute the Edict, about the year 1631, found a means to content him, which was to levy the ſaid Contributions, by certain Commiſſioners, from whom the King ſhould receive as great advantage as from the <hi>Eſleus,</hi> and yet who ſhould act nothing but by direction from the States, and thus had the Governour of the Province ſtill liberty to make his uſual profits: But the Marſhal <hi>d'Effiat</hi> Super-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendent of the Treaſuries, could not approve hereof, either by reaſon of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſts which happened between them whileſt they commanded the Army together in <hi>Piedmont;</hi> or elſe becauſe it was not juſt that the Governours of Provinces, ſhould raiſe ſuch ſums upon the people, already too much oppreſſed, and that without any benefit to the King: So that <hi>Monſieur de Montmorency</hi>'s Diſcontent, rendred <hi>Monſieur de Emery's</hi> Propoſal of accommodation of no uſe. Beſides, he was reſolved to proſecute the Office of Marſhal General of his Majeſties Camps and Armies, which would have conferred upon him, almoſt all the Functions of Conſtable, which he could not obtain, upon juſt conſiderations, he having ever ſhewed more of Courage then Prudence in his Conduct. The Refuſal hereof was the more ſenſibly reſented by him, in regard his birth and the honour his Anceſtors had in being Conſtables, perſwaded him that he deſerved it. Theſe were the chief cauſes of his diſcontents, which ingaged him to revolt; whereunto may be added, his Wifes perſwaſions, who being an Italian born, for which and her particular merits rice Queen-Mother much honoured her, ſhe ſo dealt with him, that he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced her intereſts; and conſequently, <hi>Monſieur</hi> who was then ſtrictly leagued with the Queen-Mother, for to ruine the Cardinal. For moſt certain it is, ſhe did very much contribute to ingage him in thoſe deſigns, unto which, he was of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſufficiently inclined, having naturally more fire then earth in his temper: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, he verily believed, that the great acquaintances which his fore-fathers Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours of that Province, for a long tract of tiſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

In order to this deſign, he uſed his utmoſt indeavours with the Biſhops and Nobility of <hi>Languedoc,</hi> to oblige them to him, well know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that the people are like the ſmall ſtars in the Firmament, which having no particular motions of themſelves, are guided by the higher Orbs. This his deſign ſucceeded according to his own wiſh, yet not without much detriment to his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; it being moſt certain, that the readineſſe he met in many to imbrace his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſals, was another tye to ingage him in that Revolt. His Majeſty and the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal had particular notice of all theſe Paſſages, it being impoſſible that ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivances ſhould long be kept ſecret. The Laws of Juſtice obliged his Majeſty not to delay the puniſhment due to the Authors of them; but the Cardinal, conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that Soveraigns ought not to be ſevere in ſuch affairs, untill a trial of fair means perſwade his Majeſty to indeavour by the mediation of ſome ingenious perſon, to ſet him right again in his former duty, and not only for that reaſon, but
<pb n="496" facs="tcp:56802:254"/>becauſe he thought it an act becoming a generous Prince, to preſerve a man of his quality from a ſhipwrack, which had not fallen upon him, but in regard of an inconſiderate heat and fury. He gave the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Arles,</hi> and the Sieur <hi>d'Emery</hi> inſtructions and orders to go to him, to tell him from his Majeſty what cauſes he had given of ſuſpition, that he ſhould have a care of himſelf, that if he regarded his duty, he would find it not to be lawful for a private perſon to order and govern the State as he ſhould think fit, ſuch power being only Regal: That if the good of the Province were in queſtion, War and Rebellion were but two ill remedies to redreſs the grievances and diſorders thereof. That if he deſigned to raiſe his Fortunes, Revolt was but an ill Foundation, and would be his infallible ruine, ſeeing his Majeſty had hitherto oretopt all his neighbors, and would doubtleſs do the like by him, when-ever he ſhould begin to ſtir. That in concluſion his Birth did lay an obligation upon him of being loyal, ſeeing his Anceſtors had inviolably adhered unto their Kings Intereſts; And that he could not but injure himſelf, if he ſhould eclipſe the glory they had left him, by actions contrary to theirs. Theſe Reaſons were too weighty and juſt not to remove him from his deſigns, had he never ſo little conſidered of them; but diſcontent and paſſion had taken ſuch deep root in his ſoul, that he had not the power to reflect on them; rather he ſtoutly diſowned that he had any project in hand againſt the ſervice and obedience which he owed unto his Majeſty; yet at the ſame time he perſiſted to make ſure of all ſuch as might be uſeful to him in his deſigne. Oh what blindneſs and ſtrange re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance was this! But who will not then bleſs himſelf at the Cardinal's goodneſs, which cannot without great reluctancy, perſwade his Majeſty to any rigorous pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, how juſt ſoever; who would not accept of this reſiſtance, but induced his Majeſty to give new Orders and Inſtructions in that particular, unto the Sieur <hi>de Sondeuil,</hi> thinking perchance that he would ſooner hear him then any other, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he had ever admitted him into the firſt place of his confidence?

                  <p>IT is dangerous to be wilfully obſtinate in any Deſign, and to be deaf to their counſels, who by their wiſdom may force the ill conſequences and ſucceſſes thereof. Thoſe great men, who ſuffer themſelves ſo 'to abound in their own ſenſe, are commonly the cauſers of great evils; they beget diſorders, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving fallen into any adverſity, do ruine not only themſelves, but their friends and partakers. Though <hi>Alexander</hi> wanted neither courage nor ſucceſs, yet was he blame-worthy, for ſo obſtinately refuſing the advices of the ſage Egyptians, who counſelled him not to go into <hi>Babylon,</hi> for that they found by their Art he would there die: For deſpiſing their opinions, he went thither, and was there poyſoned by <hi>Theſſalus</hi> his Phyſician. Somtimes it is prudence to change reſolutions, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſuch as are unjuſt or rebellious. It is only proper to Mountains not to run back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, but it is a wiſe mans duty to break the courſe of his conduct, if evil, and to ſteer a contrary way, which may be more propitious; to change from bad actions to good and better, though never ſo often, cannot be accounted Inconſtancy, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will any wiſe man be ſo wedded to an ill deſign, as to perſiſt in it. A prudent man receiveth counſel with joy, and maketh uſe thereof as occaſion requireth, knowing it is not lightneſs to forſake an error once found ſo to be: He had much rather confeſs his indiſcretion, then perſiſt in it; and he knoweth that ſomtimes to be vanquiſhed, is to be victorious. In fine, Stubborneſs is then eſpecially inexcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable, when it ingageth a man to fall off from that obedience which is due to his
<pb n="497" facs="tcp:56802:254"/>Soveraign. No one what-ever may take up Arms againſt Prince, upon what pretence ſoever. God hath placed the Sword in the hands of Kings, nor may any of their ſubjects draw it, unleſs by their Princes authority. Grandees are ſo much the more to be blamed for raiſing of troubles, by how much it is honourable for them to be makers of peace. They who raiſe ſeditions, and think to hide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves under a pretence of the publike good, do but deceive themſelves; for there is not any man ſo ſimple who will believe inſurrections to have been really made upon that account; and every one knows, that the firſt contrivers were ſet on work either by ambition or intereſts. But admit the State were in diſorder, it is then no more tolerable for the Grandees of the Kingdom to give the Law unto their Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign, then for the members of mans body to rule and direct the Head and Heart, thoſe chiefer parts. <hi>Marcellus</hi> who heretofore lived in Heatheniſh darkneſs, ſaid, Good Princes are to be begged from the Gods with vows and prayers; but be they what they will, they ought to be loved, honoured, feared. This was the opinion of an Heathen. But if any Nation have leſs excuſes for rebellion then others, it is doubtleſs the Chriſtian, whom God hath both in the Old and New Teſtament ſundry times commanded to be obedient unto Kings, to be reſpectful unto Superior Powers, nay patiently to ſuffer their very diſorders and Tyrannies.</p>

                  <p>SEing Parliaments have only receiv'd the power of Juſtice from Kings, that they might preſerve the obedience due unto them, and the people in their Dues and Rights, it cannot then be doubted but they are obliged to oppoſe all kinds of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volts, thoſe known deſtroyers of Royal Authority: If they be deficient on ſuch occaſions, they are defective in the chiefeſt of their Duties: The Princes Power is with them intruſted for preſervation of the Publique Peace; To what purpoſe then ſhould they let it lie dormant, when the Peoples quiet and repoſe is attempted to be diſturbed? In ſuch conjunctures it is not enough that they barely keep them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves within the limits of their duties; which example may peradventure be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to contain the vulgar ſort in good order, but they are withal obliged to lay out their utmoſt endeavours and Authority intruſted with them, for the preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their Soveraigns power, which by Civil diſſentions cannot but be very much endangered, if not totally deſtroyed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Doth not every one know, that Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are living Laws, and that they have rigours and puniſhments in their hands, wherewith to cruſh any Rebellions in their Cradles? If they ſhould be backward in reſtraining ſuch diſorders, were they not equally culpable with Souldiers, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to fight when occaſion requireth? Neither can they be guilty of this defect without ingratitude, &amp; that in the higheſt degree, for that all their Honor and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is but derivative from that of their Soveraigns. The Sun is originally clothed with that ſplendour which makes him ſhine in the eyes of all mankinde, whereas the Stars twinkle not but by a light borrowed from his; ſo have Kings an abſolute primitive power inherent in themſelves, for which they are only beholding unto God: But otherwiſe it is with Magiſtrates, who upon ſtricter enquiry into them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, will find, that they have not any Authority or Honour but what is depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent upon their Soveraigns; which if ſo, do not the Laws of gratitude, as alſo thoſe of ſubmiſſion, enjoyn them to oppoſe any thing which may intrench upon their Majeſties and Glories? And is it not likewiſe true, that by upholding their Princes Power, they preſerve their own, ſeeing in their firſt Inſtitution they were ſubordinate to them, and depending on their good Will and Pleaſure; and that themſelves cannot be continued in that Reſpect due to their Qualities, but by the preſervation and ſubſiſtence of the Original Fountain from whence theirs firſt

Rivers ceaſe to run, when their Springs are ſtopped: The Body ceaſeth to have life or motion, when deprived of the Soul; when-ever therefore Parliaments endeavour to preſerve their Princes Authority, they labour to ſuſtain themſelves, and their own Powers; and they deſtroy themſelves when-ever they forſake them.</p>

                  <p>AS in times of Revolts there ought alwaies eſpecial eye to be had upon the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrections which a Rebellious party may make, eſpecially in the abſence of heir Soveraign. His Majeſty before his removal from <hi>Paris,</hi> thought good to commit the Government of that place, and the adjacent Provinces, unto the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of ſome Princes of the Blood. Accordingly he diſpatched his letters un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Monſieur <hi>le Prince de Conde,</hi> to impower him to command in <hi>Nivernois, Berry, Bourbon, Tourain, Poictou, Aunis, Zainctonge, Haut,</hi> and <hi>Baſſe, Marcke, Limoſin,</hi> and <hi>Auvergne,</hi> to preſerve them in peace and quiet, which he intruſted with him eſpecially, in confidence that his loyalty and zeal for his ſervice, as alſo his Prudence and good Conduct, would effectually cauſe him to be very ſollicitous and diligent in preventing any troubles what ever. The Letters were accompanied with an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary and unlimitted power, which did a little ſurprize ſome people of ſmall underſtanding, who think a King never ought to intruſt ſo great a power with any Prince of the Blood. But indeed it was an effect, and that a very remarkable one, of the Cardinal's Prudence, who knew there is not any cauſe to fear the power of a Grandee, where there is any aſſurance of his being diſcreet, The Laws of Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude and Submiſſion do both oblige them to oppoſe any thing which incroacheth upon their Kings glory; and it cannot be denied but that they preſerve their own in particular, by preſerving their Kings Authority. Whilſt the Duke of <hi>Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morency</hi> was diſpoſing all things in order for the war, <hi>Monſieur</hi> marched into <hi>Albi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gieis</hi> and the Biſhop delivered <hi>Alby</hi> into his hands. He reſted there ſome time to refreſh his Army, and from thence he went, leaving five hundred horſe behind him, unto <hi>Carcaſſenne,</hi> where he held ſome intelligence; but having been inform'd of the Sieur <hi>Mangot Villarceaux</hi> his great care to preſerve the Inhabitants in their duties, he paſſed on <hi>Beziers,</hi> and gave order for a new Fortification. From thence he deſigned to march to <hi>Narbone,</hi> and make ſure of that place, by the help of ſome Intelligence which he there had, which would have been a Port at com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, to have received any aſſiſtance from <hi>Spain,</hi> as likewiſe to retire unto, in caſe of neceſſity. But he was preſently diſcomfited to hear that thoſe of his party had been over pow'red by the Arch Biſhop, and ſome other of his Majeſty's ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, who under pretence of aſſiſting him, got into the place, and ſo maſtered it. Now the King being informed of all theſe proceedings, The Reſult of the States, she Revolt of Cities, and of the inclinations of ſome Lords, thought his preſence would be neceſſary about thoſe parts; The Cardinal was of the ſame opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and aſſured his Majeſty, that if he would undertake the trouble of the jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, all thoſe ſtorms would paſs away in fix weeks time, as it fell out accordingly. Hereupon the King concluded upon the expedition, and before he left <hi>Paris,</hi> cauſed the Parliament to publiſh a Declaration in common form, againſt all thoſe who fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed <hi>Monſieur,</hi> or favoured his deſigns, proclaiming them to be Rebels, guilty of high Treaſon, and Diſturbers of the Publike Peace; commanding all Officers to proceed againſt them, according to the Rigour of the Law, yet with ſo particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar a teſtimony of affection unto <hi>Monſieur,</hi> that his Majeſty would not have him declared guilty; but its the Declaration publiſhed, That he would totally forgive him, if he acknowledged his error within ſix weeks after publication thereof. His
<pb n="500" facs="tcp:56802:256"/>Majeſty likewiſe made a Declaration ſent unto the Parliament of <hi>Tholoſe,</hi> to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim the Duke of <hi>Montmorency</hi> guity of high Treaſon, degraded from all honours and dignities, the Dutchy of <hi>Montmorency</hi> extinct, and re-united in the Crown, and all his goods confiſcate, enjoyning the Parliament of <hi>Tholoſe</hi> to make his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, and requiring all Prelats, Barons, Conſuls and Deputies of any Cities, who had aſſiſted, ſubſcribed, or aſſented unto the Reſult of the States, to appear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Parliament at <hi>Tholoſe,</hi> or the next Preſidial to their dwelling houſes, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in fifteen days after publication thereof, to diſ-own their Actions and Conſents; and in caſe of non-obedience, to be deemed as Rebels and Traytors, degraded from all honour and dignity, prohibiting the impoſing of any Taxes, by vertue of any order from the ſaid States. Moreover, his Majeſty expreſly commanded the Mareſchals <hi>de la Force,</hi> and <hi>de Schomberg,</hi> to be careful that <hi>Monſieurs</hi> levies might not draw into a Body together, but that they ſhould fall upon them upon their firſt appearance. Theſe things thus ſetled, he departed from <hi>Paris</hi> the eleventh of <hi>Auguſt.</hi> The very news of his march out of <hi>Paris,</hi> ſo encouraged his Majeſties ſervants, and diſheartned the Rebels, that all their contrivances did forthwith be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to fall. The firſt thing which befel them (but which was a great good Fortune for <hi>France</hi>) was a diviſion between their Leaders, which gave the two Mareſchals a great advantage upon them: The Sieur <hi>de Puy-Laurens</hi> had been accuſtomed to command all who came neer <hi>Monſieur,</hi> and could not now well endure that the Duke of <hi>Montmorency</hi> ſhould iſſue out Orders for the carrying on of the War; whereupon there grew a great jealouſie between them. Moreover the Duke <hi>d' El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boeuf</hi> being of another quality then the Duke of <hi>Montmorency.</hi> pretended to be <hi>Monſieurs</hi> Lievtenant General, which however the Duke would not admit off, in regard he was Governour of the Province where all the Tragedy was to be acted. Hereupon it being hard to make any accommodation between them, it was thought requiſite to part them, and to aſſigne every one what he ſhould command, who being thus divided by and amongſt themſelves, were eaſily overcome by his <hi>Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties Forces.</hi>

                  <p>THere is not any thing which giveth more advantage againſt Revolts, and in general all enemies, then the diviſion of their Commanders and Forces; if unexpectedly they fall into this diſorder, fortune is to be thanked; and if it be poſſible to contribute in the leaſt thereunto, it ought the more induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly to be attempted, in regard the effect cannot but be advantagious: All great Captains have been chiefly ſolicitous of this one thing. <hi>Coriolanus</hi> warring againſt the Romans, deſtroyed the poſſeſſions of all their principal men, but ſaved thoſe of the people, that ſo he might provoke the one againſt the other: <hi>Hannibal</hi> on the contrary, he preſerved thoſe of <hi>Fabius,</hi> but burnt all the reſt. The Thebans adviſed <hi>Mardonius</hi> to ſend great Preſents to the moſt eminent of the Grecians, that the reſt might be jealous of it: And <hi>Cleomenius</hi> the Athenian, aſſaulting the Fraezenians, caſt certain darts into the City, with Letters faſtened to them, which ſerved to raiſe a ſedition amongſt them, in the heat whereof he fell upon them, and became Maſter of the City. To prevent this diſorder, the wiſeſt Politicians have ever thought it proper<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that there ſhould not be ſeveral Heads of an Army of equal power, unleſſe every one ſo commanded in particular, that there ſhould be only one at one time to be obeyed. We ſee if it he otherwiſe, jealouſie takes place among them, and every one in particular is carefull that no one obtain any advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage which may procure him greater honour then himſelf; inſomuch that they make a difficulty to ſupport and aſſiſt one another; ſo many men, ſo many minds: This approveth one Counſel, he another; and in this diverſity of opinions, the thing commonly is left undone: Was it not to prevent this inconvenience, that the Romans, having two Conſuls, would not that both together ſhould have the marks of Soveraign authority, but that each ſhould take his turn? Did they not alſo Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain,
<pb n="501" facs="tcp:56802:256"/>that they ſhould not both together command the Armies, but each in his day? And yet notwithſtanding that care, ſome diviſions happened amongſt them.

And thus to prevent diviſions, it were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient, there were but one Head to command the motion of all the Forces, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as he ſhall think fit. <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> King of the Lacedemonians (though one of the greateſt men of Antiquity, yet) that he might countermine <hi>Lyſander,</hi> and diſcredit his Authority, abrogated his ſentences, and acted quite contrary to his adviſes: And uſually it happens, where there are two Commanders of an Army the one thwarts the others deſigns, then hatred, envy, and obſtinacy, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

It cannot be doubted, but that it was the ſecuring of thoſe Provinces, and the awing of ſuch factious ſpirits, at were inclinable to foment the troubles; for in caſe the leaſt inſurrection had been, that Army had ſoon fallen in upon them, and buried them in their own ruines. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, it was neer about that time, when the leading men of the Low-countries, weary of the Spaniſh Tyranny, inſupportable to the common people, layed the deſign of ſhaking off that yoke, and ſetting their Country at liberty: The had recourſe unto the King, to implore his protection, and made divers overtures un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, to enter upon the <hi>Comtez d' Artois</hi> and <hi>Flanders,</hi> which belonged to him by a juſt Title. But his Majeſty who never approveth of Revolts in other Princes Subjects, more then in his own, made a ſcruple of abſolute ingaging with them, or of paſſing his word to aſſiſt them in that deſign; though the Spaniards, being leſs religious in the obſervation of Treaties, and who preſerve the greatneſſe of their State, only by fomenting diviſions among their neighbours, were at that very time ingag'd to ſupport <hi>Monſieur</hi> in his revolt, and to furniſh him with Forces for the over-running of <hi>Languedoc.</hi> His Majeſty did not totally refuſe them, but kept him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in a condition of ſending them forces, in caſe the Spaniard invaded <hi>France,</hi> as they had promiſed: Thus did this Army ſerve to keep off the Spaniards in the Bay of <hi>Languedoc</hi> from landing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they miſtruſting to be repayed in the Low-countries, and doubting if they entred <hi>France,</hi> the French would do the like to aſſiſt thoſe Lords who were ſufficiently diſpoſed for revolt.

                  <p>THough Armies for the moſt part are raiſed to fight, yet ſometimes they are deſigned for other ends, wiſe Princes having oftentimes obtain'd great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages by them, without ſtriking a blow. The meer jealouſie which their motion may ſtrike into an enemy, obligeth him to ſtand upon his guard, who otherwiſe had deſign'd to aſſault ſome place; and in caſe he have aſſaulted it, to recall ſome part of his Forces to prevent any attempts. This effect is not of mean conſequence, becauſe it divideth an enemies force, and conſequently, rendreth him more eaſie to be conquered: Whileſt the Waters of a great River are all ſhut up in their own Channel, their torrent is more impetuous, their force the greater; and who ſo then indeavoureth to waft over them, runneth no ſmall hazard; whereas if diſperſed into ſeveral Rivulets; their courſe is more ſlow, their depth leſſe, ſo that they are both ſafely and eaſily to be Forded: Thus an enemies Army may ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times be ſo ſtrong, that he is to be feared, and then nothing better then to divide him, and force him to ſeparate himſelf by ſome motions which may fill him with ſuſpicions. How oft have Princes been compell'd to ſtay at home in their own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence by their apprehenſions of an Army appearing on their own Frontiers, juſt when they have been upon the point of invading their Neighbours? Beſides, what Armies ſoever a Prince placeth on his Frontiers in times of War, they alwaies give him this advantage of keeping his own Country in ſecurity; either as to Forreign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, who commonly make uſe of any pretenſions about the Borders of a Country to colour their attempts; or as to the diſcontented perſons of a Kingdom, who poſſibly may ſtir in their Prince's abſence. To preſerve Peace without making war, is an effect advantagious enough, and indeed a cauſe ſufficient always to keep an Army on Foot; A thing, in my ſenſe, of the more uſe, in regard War ought not to be made, but in order to Peace; and withal, it being more uſeful for to preſerve Peace by a ſhew of War, then by War it ſelf, that common Uſher of Fire and Sword. For this reaſon it is that a Prince ought not then to raiſe his Army, when a Forreiner is upon the point of invading his Kingdom, or when factious ſpirits are juſt ready to revolt: No, He ought to prevent both the one and the other: and the bare ſight of an Army is ſufficient to deter them from the boldneſs of any enterprize.</p>

                  <p>IT is an error to believe it impoſſible to preſerve Cities, their Caſtles once ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. Divers examples have evidenced, that, as there is hardly any force e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual to their courages who are ſtoutly reſolv'd to defend themſelves; ſo there is not any thing which can compel a City to ſurrender, when it may be forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fi'd againſt the Caſtle, and whoſe Inhabitants are men of courage. The order which the Commander of ſuch a place ought to follow, is, firſt to inform himſelf whether the people be divided, whether ſome party among them be not well-wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

He is likewiſe oblig'd to uſe extraordinary diligence in raiſing Fortifications to ſecure it againſt the Caſtle, to guard the Ports, and all Avennues, with Souldiers ſufficient to make good any aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault againſt thoſe of the Caſtle, in caſe they ſhould attempt it. To this end, if there be not ſufficient Force among the Inhabitants, trained up in the Exerciſes of War, he ought not to be defective in procuring them from other places; He ſhall do prudently, if he viſit the main-guard every hour, to ſee that all be in a readineſs. If the City be weak on any quarter, whereby it may be liable to a ſurprize, he ought to be dexterous in Fortifying it? and in concluſion, having once brought the place into a poſture of Defence, he then ought to reſolve on laying ſiege to the Caſtle: for as an aſſault addeth more courage to the Aſſailors then the Defendants, ſo doubtleſs his will ſhew more valour, then if they were reduced to the neceſſity of their own proper defence. But that which I eſteem moſt conſiderable, is, that thoſe of the Caſtle once ſurrounded and beſieged, date not attempt any thing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the City, having enough to do to defend themſelves: He ought ſo to inveſt the Caſtle, that there may be no way left for the carrying of men or proviſions into it: which once brought to perfection, unleſs they are excellently provided, the Garriſon will ſoon be ſtraitned: If there be any Hill which doth command it, it were proper to raiſe a Battery thereon, whereby to play upon the Caſtle: as alſo to fill the higheſt Steeples with Souldiers, who by often ſhooting at them where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they appear, may in the end tyre them out. Neither is it leſs neceſſary that he have Souldiers abroad upon all Avennues, to prevent any relief; and thus the prudence of a Governour animated by his Courage, may ſecure a City after the loſs of its Caſtle.</p>

He was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned from <hi>Beaucaire,</hi> having left the Duke <hi>d' Elboeuf</hi> there to ſecure the Caſtle if poſſible. The Duke <hi>de Montmorency</hi> was come with him, who animated him to
<pb n="505" facs="tcp:56802:258"/>fight; The Baron <hi>de Linieres</hi> offered himſelf to go and diſcover the ſtate of the Mareſchal's Army, which that he might the more eaſily and ſecurely effect, he went in he habit of a <hi>Cordelier,</hi> which only ſerved to render him ſuſpected, ſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent was it that he had ſeldom uſed to wear it.

The Marquis was the firſt who diſcovered <hi>Monſieur</hi>'s Army, within two Muſquet ſhot of the way, at what time he was paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the King's Army over a little River, in the Valley. Now conceiving by the Enemy's countenance, that they deſign'd to let him paſs over a ſmall narrow Bridge with one half of his Army, which conſiſted only of a thouſand Horſe, four Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies of his Mjeſty's Regiment <hi>des Gardes,</hi> and ſix of that of <hi>Chamblay,</hi> that they might the better fall upon the Rear-guard, and break it, being in a condition not to be relieved; he gave notice to the Mareſchal <hi>de Schomberg,</hi> how he thought fit to paſs the Army by a good paſſage about two thouſand paces higher, by which they might get over before the Enemy could diſcover their intent. The Mareſchal approved his advice, as very judicious; and having ſignified as much to him, he put it in execution, and whole Army paſſed the Brook, before any of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my advanced towards them. They preſently ſaw the Army in Battalia within a great Meadow, and withall, to give the Kings Army leave to paſſe, they drew off a little neerer <hi>Caſtelnaudary:</hi> But had they taken their ſtations, when the enemy in haſt paſſed the River, who were payed in their own coyn; for the Marſhal <hi>de Schomberg</hi> diſcovering their Forlorn Hope, ſent to charge them before they were all paſſed over; the foot made their ſhot, as alſo the enemy's, and the Horſe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing, were at firſt impeded by certain ditches, though the <hi>Sieurs de Loriers,</hi> and <hi>de Beauregard Champreu,</hi> found a way to paſſe through with twelve or fifteen of their followers: And <hi>Monſieur de Montmorency,</hi> who was advanced onely to diſcover them, came on preſently, and charged them with an hundred Gentlemen, they met with all poſſible courage, but with great loſſe on <hi>Monſieur</hi>'s part; for the <hi>D. de Montmorency</hi> was wounded, the <hi>Comtes de Rieux,</hi> and <hi>de la Fucillade</hi> ſlain, four or five hundred ſlain upon the place, and amongſt them the <hi>Comte de Moret;</hi> for the Kings Musquetiers having diſcharged upon their Horſe, beat them out of the Field, inſomuch as <hi>Monſieur de Montmorency,</hi> was on a ſudden forſaken by all, ſaving four or five of his followers. His courage was nevertheleſſe ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuous, that he was not moved at it; but on the contrary, ſuffering himſelf to be tranſported by an inconſiderate raſhneſs, as if his wounds had bereft him of ſenſe, he advanced from the place where he was, with thoſe four or five others in his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, into the Field, where meeting the Mareſchal <hi>de Schombergh</hi>'s company of <hi>Gendarmes,</hi> he gave and received ſome wounds, both of Sword and Piſtol, without any more conſideration of the danger he ran, then if he had been immortal: He charged up to the very Guards, and <hi>Chamblay</hi>'s Regiment, where they diſcharged ſo thick on him, that his Horſe being wounded in divers places, fell down, and his Maſter under him, by which means he was taken Priſoner by the Officers and Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers of the Regiment <hi>des Gardes;</hi> which yet was ſo far from incouraging <hi>Monſieur</hi>'s Army to endeavour the fetching of him off, rather on the contrary, they were ſo aſtoniſh'd at it, that they kept their ſtand, as if fear and grief had equally ſurpriz'd them. Hereupon the Mareſchal <hi>de Schomberg,</hi> and the Marquis <hi>de Breze</hi> found that they were out of danger, and having diſcourſed ſome few minutes concerning the preſent State of affairs, they judged, that having fought ſo luckily, ſlain ſo many perſons of quality, and taken him priſoner who was the ſoul of the Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it would be improper to run a ſecond hazard; becauſe having the perſon of Monſieur <hi>de Montmorency,</hi> the reſidue of the revolt would diſſipate of it ſelf, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out neceſſitating the King's Forces to go fight <hi>Monſieur</hi>'s Army afreſh, by a ſtrait Bridge, where but few could march together, and that within Cannon-ſhot. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="506" facs="tcp:56802:259"/>they made a ſtand about and hour in the field, to ſee if the enemy would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand any thing, but perceiving them not to advance, they drew off the King's Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to the City and Suburbs of <hi>Caſtelnaudary,</hi> where Monſieur <hi>de Montmorency</hi> was kept for ſome time, until his wounds would permit him to be conducted to ſome place of greater ſecurity, and that his Majeſty's pleaſure concerning him were known.</p>

                  <p>IT is uſual with Souldiers upon obtaining any great advantage in fight, to proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute their Victory to the full; but a prudent General is obliged to curb in their impetuouſneſs, and to enjoy the favours of Fortune with great moderation; The ſatisfaction of ſeeing his enemies overcome with fear, ought not to blind him, but he ought to make uſe of Prudence, and not to run the hazard of loſing a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Victory already obtain'd, in hopes of a greater, but uncertain; He who can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be contented with an indifferent Victory, endangereth the loſing of that which he hath gotten. Briefly, It is great raſhneſs to drive an enemy to extremities; for, to reduce them to a neceſſity of fighting, doth often expel all fear from them, filleth them with courage, raiſeth up one to be as good as four, and redeems the Victory they had loſt. What, but neceſſity made the <hi>Locrois</hi> behave themſelves ſo couragiouſly, that fifteen thouſand of them defeated an hundred and thirty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand of their enemies? Was it not the ſame neceſſity, as Hiſtory obſerves, which made the <hi>Romans,</hi> when ſo hotly purſued by the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> that they had not time to retire to their Veſſels, to turn again, make a ſtand, fight like Lyons, kill two hundred of them, and take as many Priſoners? The Conſul <hi>Manlius,</hi> that not a man of his enemies might eſcape him, ſet ſtrong Guards upon all places by which they were to retreat, but the enemy perceiving it, and knowing the impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of ſaving themſelves, fell upon him, ſlew him, and became ſo furious, that they had likewiſe cut the reſt in pieces, had they not had free liberty to retreat granted them. For this very reaſon it was, that the French retreating from <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi> the ableſt Italians were of opinion, to let them have free liberty of depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and which is more, if occaſion were, to favour their retreat.

                  </head>
                  <p>BUt that I may ſay ſomthing of the event of this Treaty, I ſhall tell you how the Sieur <hi>d' Aiguebonne</hi> coming to <hi>Monſieur,</hi> found him much diſcontented, not only for Monſieur <hi>de Montmorency</hi> being taken, but to ſee moſt of the Nobility of <hi>Languedoc</hi> falling off from him; which did not a little affright the Sieur <hi>de Puy-Leurens,</hi> and thoſe of his Faction, no leſs ſollicitous of their own, then their Maſter's interſt; who then began to miſdoubt their being taken, and made ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of his Majeſty's Juſtice; for that he was obliged to puniſh the whole Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion upon their perſons, they having been the chief contrivers thereof. Neither were they leſs afflicted for having miſs'd of thoſe advantages which they fancy'd to obtain by the War. But on the other ſide, conſidering the preſervation of life is to be preferr'd before all other Intereſts, they had already concluded, that <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur</hi> wanting Forces to carry on the War, ſhould ſeem to deſire Peace from the King, the only way to ſecure them from otherwiſe unavoydable misfortunes, and to betake them to their Arms again upon the firſt occaſion of advantage, which might give them hopes of better ſucceſs. <hi>Monſieur</hi> was the more readily inclined to follow their advice, in regard he found himſelf unable to proſecute the War, and reduced to a neceſſity of ſubmitting to that Law which his Majeſty would im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe on him; ſo that he had already ſent the Sieur <hi>de Chaudebonne</hi> towards his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, to teſtifie unto him his ſorrow for having given him occaſion of diſcontent; and to make him all ſorts of Proteſtations of Obedience and Loyaltie for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; beſeeching him to forget what was paſt, and by the affection wherewith he had ever honour'd him, to moderate that anger he might have conceived againſt him for his late proceedings: Withal <hi>Chaudebonne</hi> had order to beg Monſieur <hi>de Montmorency</hi>'s Freedom, his re eſtabliſhment in his Goods and Offices, and the like for the Duke <hi>de Bellegarde,</hi> with all other his Adherents, or the Queen-Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. To demand a place of Security for <hi>Monſieur,</hi> That the Queer-Mother ſhould be recall'd; That the places depoſited by Monſieur <hi>de Lorrain</hi> ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored; That a million of Livres ſhould be granted to <hi>Monſieur,</hi> to pay off what he had borrowed from the Spaniards and the Duke of <hi>Lorrain;</hi> and that the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt iſſued out againſt the Lady <hi>du Fargis,</hi> ſhould be repealed. All this had been acted before the Sieur <hi>d' Aiguibonne</hi>'s Arrival; ſo that his coming to <hi>Monſieur</hi> was not a little welcom, all his Retinue beholding him as their Deliverer; and the Wiſeſt among them were unable to admire the Exceſs of his Majeſty's Bounty.</p>

                  <p>AMongſt the divers marks of <hi>Good-Will,</hi> Compaſſion (the Mother thereof) is the moſt aſſured; it being certain, that none is ſollicitous to ſet a perſon indifferent to him, or againſt whom he hath ſome cauſe of anger, reduced to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity. Indifferency is too ſtupid to excite any ſentiments of grief at others ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings; and the heat of blood and choler cauſe joy rather then ſadneſs. A man from the top of ſome Hill beholdeth with delight his enemies Veſſel beaten by a Tempeſt, with his Maſts already broken, and Sayls torn, ready to be ſwallowed up by the fury of the Winds and Waves; but otherwiſe is he affected if the Ship
<pb n="508" facs="tcp:56802:260"/>contain any perſon who is dear unto him; at ſuch a ſight he would be wholly tranſported with grief, his eyes would be lifted up to Heaven, and he would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently addreſſe himſelf to ſend him aſſiſtance: In the ſame manner is a great Prince touch'd with compaſſion for thoſe who relate to him, or are eſteemed by him, when he ſees them reduced to any deplorable condition. The Arms which they have carried againſt him cannot prevent ſuch ſentiments, it being moſt certain that true generouſneſſe never delights to behold a very enemy reduced to the utmoſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity of misfortune. A well-grounded courage will rejoyce to obtain a victory againſt his enemy, but then he uſeth all means he can to comfort him in his afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and beareth ſome part of his ſadneſſe with him. Thus a noble Roman Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, having defeated the Macedonians, began to ſhed tears when he ſaw their King brought Priſoner before him, and riſing from his ſeat, went to receive him with all honour, as a grand perſon fallen by accident into ſuch misfortune; and when he caſt himſelf at his feet, would not ſuffer it, but raiſed him with a ſence of compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for that eſtate, wherein he then beheld him. In the ſame manner the Samnite having overthrown two Roman Conſular Armies at the <hi>Furcae Caudinae,</hi> and brought them into ſlavery, would not enter into the City of <hi>Capua</hi> but by night, as if they would compaſſionately hide the confuſions which they ſaw them ſuffer under the obſcurity of darkneſſe: In concluſion, pittying their diſtreſſe, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored to the Conſuls their dgnities, their faſces, their Uſhers, with the reſt of their Train, and thus entring into <hi>Capua,</hi> both Magiſtrates and people came to comfort them. In the ſame manner, the ruine which befalleth perſons of eminent quality, deſerves the more pity from the greatneſſe of their fall, and in regard their confuſion is expoſed not onely to a family or City, but many times to all <hi>Europe.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>MOnſieur</hi> received theſe teſtimonies of the King's Clemency, whileſt he was yet at <hi>Caſtelnaudary,</hi> and though his preſent extremity cauſed him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them with a great deal of ſatisfaction, yet his affection for the D. of <hi>Montmorency</hi> kept him off from concluding any thing, untill he had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to obtain ſome aſſurances of his life and liberty: He ſeemed unto the <hi>Sieur de Aiguebonne,</hi> to be exceeding ſenſible of his Majeſties goodneſſe, beſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching him to aſſure his Majeſty that he was very ſorry for having offended him; that he was firmly reſolved to render him all manner of obedience for the future, and never to thwart his pleaſure: In brief, he deſired him to beſeech his Majeſty in his behalf, as himſelf moſt humbly did, to grant, according to his uſual clemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, thoſe graces he had already requeſted by <hi>Chaudebonne,</hi> particulary in the behalf of the D. of <hi>Montmorency.</hi> That he reſpectfully accepted his Majeſties offers, but that, adding that one favour to the perſon who he loved, and one who had not ingaged but for his ſake, he ſhould be infinitely much more obliged, and that he would then go any whither where his Majeſty ſhould think fit. The <hi>Sieur de Aiguebonne,</hi> returned with this anſwer of <hi>Monſieurs</hi> to the King, being yet at <hi>Pont-Saint Esprit,</hi> but there had been a return made thereunto by <hi>Chaudebonne,</hi> who had ſet forward the day before; by whom his Majeſty writ to <hi>Monſieur</hi> that he could not grant him any other thing that what had already been propoſed to the <hi>Sieur de Aiguebonne,</hi> and conjur'd him to accept of them without making other pretenſions, his demands being neither agreeable to his Majeſties dignity, the good of the State, nor his own proper intereſt. Now <hi>Chaudebonne</hi> returning with this Letter to <hi>Monſieur,</hi> his Highneſſe was not a little troubled to ſee the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of delivering the D. <hi>de Montmorency</hi> from the danger wherein he was; but the <hi>Sieur de Puy-Laurens,</hi> not forgetfull of thoſe jealouſies which had been between them, was ſolicitous to extinguiſh thoſe thoughts, and preſſed <hi>Monſieur</hi> to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw himſelf from the Precipice, by laying before him the obſolute neceſſities, as his affairs then ſtood, either of ruine or accommodation; neither did he much

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> and then retired into <hi>Beziers</hi> with part of his Forces, which, however quartered there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts, but neither the Governour nor Inhabitants would permit them to enter. This was the cauſe that he made no long ſtay there, but departed on the twentieth of <hi>September</hi> before four in the morning by torch-light, having received an A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>arm that the Kings Army commanded by the Marſhals <hi>de Vitry,</hi> and <hi>de la Force</hi> were making their approaches to beſiege him. Mean while the King removed from <hi>Pont-Saint Eſprit,</hi> and came to <hi>Niſmes,</hi> where <hi>Chaudebonne,</hi> who but three days before, had returned towards <hi>Monſieur,</hi> came again to meet his Majeſty, and re-inforce the former Propoſitions, and more eſpecially to procure that the favour which his Majeſty granted unto <hi>Monſieur</hi> might be extended unto all of his party. But his Majeſty perſiſted in admitting of no other conditions, whereupon <hi>Chaudebonne</hi> gave ſome hopes that <hi>Monſieur</hi> might be perſwaded to ſubmit, in caſe any one went to treat with him from his Majeſty, for that the <hi>Sieur de Puy-Laurens</hi> was labouring to perſwade him thereunto. By this his Highneſſe was reduced to ſuch extremity, that he knew not well where to make any ſure retreat, his forces being many of them disbanded, and thoſe of <hi>Beziers</hi> it ſelf, now in his Majeſties obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and who, after his departure from them, had made freſh proteſtations of fidelity to him, refuſed to receive him; and in concluſion, had not admitted him at all but by order from his Majeſty, who commanded them to receive him, but with his Train onely, and to render him all the honour due to his quality. The King approved of the overture, and ſeeing <hi>Monſieur</hi> was at <hi>Beziers,</hi> ſent unto him the <hi>Sieur de Bullion</hi> Superintendent of the Treaſury, and the Marqueſſe <hi>de Foſſez,</hi> Governour of <hi>Montpellier,</hi> but without any other conditions then thoſe, propoſed by the <hi>Sieur de Aiguebonne:</hi> At their firſt arrival <hi>Monſieur</hi> declared, that he could not reſolve to abandon the D of <hi>Montmorency,</hi> who had not ingaged himſelf in that War but for his ſake, no more than the reſt of his adherents; that for any thing elſe he was unalterably fixt to render all obedience and ſervice to his Majeſty. They replied, that indeed ſuch ſentiments could not but be commendable, neither could they proceed from any thing beſide the goodneſſe of his nature; and beſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched his Highneſſe to conſider, that if he had any intereſt in their concerns, the King had incomparably much more reaſon not to capitulate at all with him, or to grant, by way of compulſion, any grace to ſuch Rebellious Subjects, who had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferved the moſt rigorous chaſtizements of his Juſtice. They repreſented to him, that capitulations ought not to be made but between Soveraigns, and that Princes though of his quality, had no other way to obtain grace, but by ſubmiſſion and acknowledgement of their faults; that he might reaſonably expect any favour from his Majeſties goodneſſe, ſeeing, his Majeſty had of his own meer motion, and that before any overtures made by him unto him to obtain his favour, ſent to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite him; that after all this, to miſtruſt his Clemency would be injurious; that for their parts they could not enſure him of any favour for the D. <hi>de Montmorency.</hi> or any other his Domeſticks, having no order but the former; but that they might ſafely tell him, that in caſe it ſhould ſtand with his Majeſties ſervice, to extend his favour towards all thoſe whom his Highneſſe deſired, his own innate Clemency would invite him thereunto; that in fine, his Majeſty was doubtleſſe obliged to inflict ſome exemplary puniſhment upon the chief Authors of that Revolt, as a thing neceſſary to ſecure the tranquility of the State, to maintain his Majeſties au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, to deter others, and to chaſtize this Rebellion, which of it ſelf compelled his Majeſty to execute ſome juſtice, unleſſe he would render himſelf culpable againſt his own eſtate. Theſe reaſons were urged with ſuch addreſſe, moderation, and prudence, that <hi>Monſieur</hi> was from that time, almoſt abſolutely reſolved to ſubmit himſelf unto his Majeſties Will, yet ſome time he deſired to conſider of it; which was in effect, that he might the better confer with the <hi>Sieur de Puy-Laurens,</hi> who
<pb n="510" facs="tcp:56802:261"/>finding no other way left then that of accommodation whereby to ſecure himſelf from the danger he was in, induced <hi>Monſieur</hi> to reſolve to treat; he alledged to him that he ought to make the leſſe difficulty of it, in regard he might afterwards take his own advantage, and put himſelf in a condition to obtain more advantagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous terms; and in fine, he acquainted the <hi>Sieur de Bullion,</hi> and the Marqueſſe <hi>de Foſſez</hi> with <hi>Monſieurs</hi> reſolution; they took his word, and the Articles of accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation were concluded, by which <hi>Monſieur</hi> acknowledging his fault beſeeched his Majeſty:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, That he would forget and forgive him: He promiſed his Majeſty to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapſe no more; that he would relinquiſh all intelligences with Forreigners, and with the Queen-Mother, during her abode out of the Kingdom, contrary to his Majeſties Will.</p>
                  <p>That he would dwell in ſuch place as his Majeſty would preſcribe, and live like a true Brother and Subject.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, <hi>Monſieur</hi> obliged himſelf not to take any part in their Intereſt who were ingaged with him; nor complain, if at any time the King ſhould bring them to condigne puniſhment.</p>
                  <p>To receive ſuch perſons as his Majeſty ſhould nominate into the Offices which ſhould at any time become vacant in his family; and to remove ſuch as ſhould be diſagreeable to his Majeſty.</p>
                  <p>Briefly, It was agreed that the <hi>Sieur de Puy-Laurens,</hi> having been the chief Agent of thoſe evil Councels, which had ingaged <hi>Monſieur</hi> in the War, ſhould be obliged ſincerely to inform his Majeſty of what ever had been negotiated for the time paſt, by which the State might receive any prejudice, and that under penalty of being reputed Criminal, and to have incurred his Majeſties diſpleaſure.</p>
                  <p>Theſe were the chief Articles whereunto <hi>Monſieur</hi> conſented, an aſſured teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony they were of his natural inclination to live quietly and ſubmiſſely: They were ſigned by him for his Majeſties greater aſſurance; and thereupon the <hi>Sieurs de Bullion</hi> and <hi>Foſſex,</hi> promiſed him in his Majeſty behalf, that his Majeſty ſhould receive him into his favor, eſtabliſh him in al his goods and penſions; give him liberty to live peaceably in ſuch of his houſes, as ſhould be thought fit, and that a pardon ſhould be granted to <hi>Monſieur de Elboeuf,</hi> and all others then reſiding neer his perſon, without ingaging any thing for the reſt.</p>
                  <p>His Majeſty received theſe Articles by the Marqueſſe <hi>de Foſſez,</hi> and according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ratified them; and thus was this deſired agreement concluded, which every one conſidered as one of the moſt certain foundations of <hi>France</hi> its happineſſe. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing was diſcourſed of but Peace: the King permitted the ſtrangers ſix days time to march out of <hi>France</hi> by <hi>Rouſſillon,</hi> who ſcattering themſelves abroad from one Coaſt to another, received the ſame entertainment from the Country people as they had before offered unto them. <hi>Monſieur</hi> retired to his houſe of <hi>Champigzy</hi> near <hi>Tours,</hi> ſeemed to be ſatisfied in his very ſoul, and withall writ ſeveral Letters to the Cardinal full of affectionate expreſſions, diſowning thoſe aſperſions publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed againſt him under his name, aſſuring him, that he had never conſented to them in a though, and that in his greateſt Paſſion he had ever much eſteem for him, not only in regard of his loyalty towards the King, but alſo for his eminent vertues, and the great ſervices he had done the State. And thus every one ſaw an agreeable calm ſucceed that ſtorm wherewith <hi>France</hi> had been ſo much agitated.</p>

                  <p>AS Kings are obliged to chaſtize ſome of the chief Authors of a revolt, as ſhall hereafter be declared, ſo ought they readily to pardon the reſt, <hi>Caeſar</hi> was more eſteemed for his eaſie condiſcenſion to be reconciled to his enemies, that <hi>Hannibal</hi> for his harſh courage. It was his uſual ſaying, that nothing
<pb n="511" facs="tcp:56802:261"/>was leſſe proper for thoſe who aſpired unto great things, than willfully to perſiſt in enmities, which oftentimes cauſe thoſe forces, which were deſign'd for great atchievements, to be made uſe of in a mans own defence, and to ſecure him for the ambuſhments of his enemies. Clemency ought to ſhut a Soveraign's eys, that he may no more behold their faults, who beg his favour in matters of revolt, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving firſt layed by ſome of the chief, for examples ſake. And is it not then a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous revenge to pardon a man already overcome, eſpecially if he be of the ſame blood? Pardon is ſometimes as difficult to be ſupported by Grandees, as the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion of a defeat; ſome have choſen rather to periſh then to beg it. Withall, a King is ſo far from receiving any detriment in his government by granting it, the rather on the contrary, Clemency is a ſpell which charmeth every one to love him; it is one of the ſtrongeſt Pillars of his State, beſides the glory which it carries with it, whoſe ſplendour is not ſmall, generoſity having no ſtamp more venerable then Clemency. And Experience evidenceth, that all good courages have a natural ſweetneſſe to cure wounds, without leaving any ſcars behind them. The Herb, called by <hi>Homer, Nepenthe,</hi> preſented to <hi>Helen</hi> by the Queen of <hi>Egypt,</hi> was much eſteemed of for the allaying of all griefs, for cauſing an oblivion of offences, and for reſtoring the ſame ſentiments of affection, which had been before the breach of friendſhip. The Grecians were eſteem'd very wiſe, who, when they could find no other expedient to redreſſe the many crimes, during the time of the thirty Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants, publiſhed a Decree by them called the Amneſty, commanding they ſhould all be buried in Oblivion; and the valiant <hi>Scipio</hi> took the ſame courſe with his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volted Souldiers, telling them, he deſired Oblivion might efface their fault, and in caſe that could not do it, it might at leaſt be ſmothered in ſilence, to the intent it might not be caſt in their teeth. All that Princes have to conſider in communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating the effects of their Clemency, is, ſo to pardon, that they leave neither the courage nor the liberty of relapſing into a ſecond fault, by making ſure of thoſe who may occaſion it. Thoſe who humble themſelves, they ought to ſet free from the rigours of their juſtice; yet the favours they grant ought to be managed with ſuch prudence, that whileſt they forget thoſe crimes which they pardon, the other may forget their ways of offending them.</p>

                  <p>IT is not enough to beat Rebels out of the field, and to force them to their houſes; a Soveraign is moreover obliged to eſtabliſh ſuch an Order in the Province where the Rebellion hath been, that it remain not expoſed to the danger of a ſecond ſtorm, after he ſhall withdraw himſelf. He ought judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly to imitate the Prudent Phyſician, who having rais'd his Patient out his bed, indeavoureth to re-eſtabliſh his temper, and to reſtore him to ſuch a condition of health that he may not fear a relapſe. It would be a great raſhneſſe to puniſh all that are guilty; ſo to do, would aſſuredly raiſe a greater revolt, and which inſtead of troubling one ſingle Province, might indanger the whole Kingdome. It is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed proper to aſſemble ſome of them, that he may receive and acknowledgement of their crimes, their ſubmiſſions, and their repentance; that once paſt, his Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency ought to pardon the multitude, his Juſtice having reſerved ſome of the Ring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaders for exemplary puniſhment. Thus <hi>Ariſtides</hi> having received intelligence in the War, how ſome the nobleſt of the Athenians, finding themſelves oppreſſed by poverty, and diſcontented to ſee themſelves depriv'd of that Authority they had formerly injoyed in them management of affairs, had conſpired againſt the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and reſolved to deliver the Common-Wealth into the hands of the Barbari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, rather then live in the eſtate whereunto they were then reduced, ſatisfied him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with cauſing eight of the principle to be taken to puniſhment, and exhorted the reſt to behave themſelves with ſuch courage, that their generouſneſſe might efface the memory of ſo ignominious and enterprize; which one thing wrought more effectually with them, then if he had ſeverely puniſhed them. It is only fit for inferiour Judges to raiſe informations againſt all the particular acceſſaries to a crime: Kings, who Clemency maketh far more glorious then Severity, ought to wink at the diſorders of the multitude, ſeeing they had not ingaged in a Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but by the Artifice of the chief men of the Province, who are more in fault on, but by the Artifice of the chief men of the Province, who are more in fault then all the reſt. I will moreover adde, that it were proper they did a little ſwee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten thoſe Orders which claſh with the peoples ſence, and which have ſerved for a pretence to their Rebellion; for it is exceeding dangerous to be obſtinately reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute in any thing that goes againſt the hair of the multitude; not that I ſhould think it Prudence to admit of what ever they deſire, that were too baſe a conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcenſion, and would imbolden them too too much; a mean ought to be uſed, and a more pleaſing way to obtain the ſame ends. The higheſt point of diſcretion conſiſteth in acquiring the end we propoſe, by ſuch windings as may beſt convey us to it, though it be the further way about; and the greateſt Triumph of reaſon ſeemeth ſometimes to yeeld to Time and Neceſſity, and to ſit ſtill with effecting, though not all we would, yet what we may without exaſperating the people. A King may lawfully, without all peradventure, eſtabliſh that which is right, and which carrieth with it any advantage to the publick, but Prudence ought to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede all his Decrees, and he ought to be carefull that there happen not at any time more evil then good by his commands.</p>

                  <head>The Requests of divers Lords for <hi>Monſieur de Montmorency,</hi> his life and liberty.</head>
                  <p>ALthough his Majeſty had pardoned the common fry, yet the Duke of <hi>Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morency</hi> being their chief Ring-leader, there was ſmall likelihood of paſſing by his Delinquency, without due puniſhment, unleſſe it were purpoſely to give all other Governours free liberty to rebell as often as they pleaſed, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering how it was by the chance of War, and his own only raſhneſs, that he fell into the hands of his Majeſties Officers. For this reaſon it was, that the King comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him to be carried to <hi>Tholoſe</hi> (whither his Majeſty came not long after) im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned in the Town-Houſe, and ſent a particular Commiſſion to the Parliament to proſecute his Indictment againſt him. He was examined, witneſſes produced face to face, according to courſe, neither was there any great difficulty in proving ſuch things as made him guilty of death; he having been taken with his Sword in his hand, againſt the King, as himſelf confeſſed (adding with tears in his eyes, as is uſual with all perſons of quality, when they find themſelves convicted; That if it would pleaſe his Majeſty to pardon him his life, he would not deſire to obtain it unleſſe to lay it out in his ſervice, and that he might expiate part of his Crimes, with his Blood. Sundry perſons of quality, and amongſt others, the Princeſſe of <hi>Conde</hi> his ſiſter; the Cardinal <hi>de la Valette,</hi> and the Dukes <hi>d' Eſpernon,</hi> and <hi>de Cheureuſe,</hi> were very earneſt with the King to obtain his pardon, and <hi>Monſieur</hi> himſelf ſent the <hi>Sieur de Lavaupot,</hi> to caſt himſelf at his Majeſties feet, and to Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition in his behalf. But what likelihood was there, of paſſing by ſo hainous an offence without chaſtizing it? What reaſon was there to give life unto him, who had indeavoured to raiſe all the Grandees in the Kingdom, with whom he had the leaſt acquaintance, who had uſed his utmoſt to ingage one of the chief Provinces of the Kingdom in a Rebellion, who had induced <hi>Monſieur</hi> to march in Arms through all <hi>France,</hi> that he might the better countenance his deſigns, who had introduc'd the Spaniard, who had had the boldneſſe to procure the States of the Province to authorize his Rebellion, who had raiſed all the Souldiers he poſſibly could againſt the King: briefly, who had left no ſtone unturn'd which might any ways contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to the advancement of his pernicious deſigns? What reaſon can there be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged ſufficient to excuſe ſuch a crime? It was not a fault committed by miſtake, or raſhly, but a deſigned contrivance deliberated and diſcuſſed; for the effecting whereof, he had bent all his wits, and ſet all his Engines on work, for above ſeven or eight moneths together. His name was indeed honourable, in regard of his Anceſtors, but he deſerved no honour for having been deficient in following the Copies of their Loyalty, was his family illuſtrious, his Crime was of the greater conſequence and the more dangerous for perſons of his quality, eſpecially ſuch as had raiſed great advantages by the favours conferr'd upon them, and the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his offence ought to be exemplary, to warn the Nobility to contain them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves within the bounds of their duties, and within the limits of fear of his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties Juſtice. He had indeed done his Majeſty ſervice in two or three occaſions, but not ſuch as were any way conſiderable, with that of this his attempt, which ſtrook at the root of the Kingdom, which forced the people from their obedience, which tended to the deſtruction of his Majeſties authority, and the ruine of his Subjects. What would ſtrangers have ſaid at the report of ſuch exceſſive Clemency, far diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from thoſe prudent ſeverities which themſelves frequently exemplifie unto us, upon the leaſt commotions in their own Countries? Had it not been a wilfull blindneſſe in matters of State, and the eſtabliſhment of the publick quiet to have ſuffered ſuch a Rebellion to paſſe unpuniſhed? To ſay truth, he muſt have no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger been a King, had he tied up the hands of Juſtice, and hindred her from proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting thoſe Orders preſcribed by the Laws on ſuch occaſions. Thus the Marſhal <hi>de Chaſtillon,</hi> going to wait upon the King, with intent to join his requeſt with
<pb n="514" facs="tcp:56802:263"/>others in his behalf told him, that the countenance and eys of thoſe who ſupplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him, did ſufficiently declare, that his Majeſty would oblige very many perſons, if it would pleaſe him to pardon <hi>Monſieur de Montmorency's</hi> life, but was anſwer'd with a Prudence well-becomming his Majeſty that he ſhould not be King, if his ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents were ſuch as thoſe of private men.</p>

                  <p>A King would render himſelf much blame-worthy towards his State, if in all his actions he did not regard the publick good, before the ſatisfaction of divers perſons. Good Emperours even according to the opinion of the moſt eminent Lights of the Church, have preferr'd the State before their Fathers or children; and indeed of ſuch conſideration ought it to be unto them, ſeeing they are obliged not to give way to their own wills, when they deſire any thing in prejudice thereof. Were it not a madneſſe to expoſe all the Souls in a Veſſel to th hazard of Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack, by indeavouring to ſave one particular man? Seeing the very life of a King ought not by himſelf to be conſidered, when as the publick good is in agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, of what weight then ought anothers life be to him? The object of Princes is the civil good, and is folded up in that of the people in general. No one can doubt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but that it is for the intereſt and advantage of the people, to prefer the common good, before that of any particular man, who hath run into any hainous offences. So the Laws have more regard to the ſafety of all, then of any one criminal, and that Prince who being obliged to propoſe to himſelf the Laws for a guide of his Actions, will commit a manifeſt overſight, if he dotq<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

It is the property of private men, to be ſolicitous of private concernments, and it is the duty of a King to regard nothing in regard of the publick good.</p>

The Father went to him, and found that God beſtowed may Graces upon him, in order to his well-dying; to which end, he deſired to make a general Confeſſion. One thing did ſomewhat trouble him, which was this, he beleeved that to acquit himſelf of this pious duty; there
<pb n="515" facs="tcp:56802:263"/>would be longer time required, then was probably left for him; he ſuppoſing, as accordingly it was that they had reſolv'd to ſentence him the next morning where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he earneſtly conjured the Father <hi>Arnoux,</hi> and the <hi>Sieur de Launay</hi> to go and acquaint his Majeſty that he beſeeched him to beſtow the next whole morning upon him, that he might the more deliberately and without moleſtation, look back into his Conſcience, that he might make ſuch a Confeſſion, as might cauſe him to die without inquietude of mind, and that he ſhould take this for one of the greateſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours he had ever received from him. The King condeſcended thereunto, and his Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety being no leſſe reſplendent then his Juſtice, he readily granted him that liberty, commanding, that the ſentencing of him ſhould be deferr'd for one day; and alſo permitting him to communicate, although contrary to the uſe for perſons in his condition. He ended thoſe holy duties, which once paſſed over, he employed the afternoon in making his Will, according as his Majeſty had permitted him, wherein he bequeathed unto <hi>Monſieur</hi> the Cardinal, one eſteemed for the rareſt peece of <hi>France,</hi> being a Picture, repreſenting Saint <hi>Sebaſtian</hi> dying, and beſeeched him to believe that he died his ſervant. The morning following, he was called unto the Palace to be examined at the Bar where be anſwered unto all Interrogations, ſuch ſubmiſſion and generouſneſſe, that he diſcovered no other fear of death, but with what is natural to the greateſt courages; and at the ſame time that he went out of the grand Chamber, the whole Court (the Lord Keeper being Preſident) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned him to be beheaded in the place <hi>du Salin,</hi> as guilty of High Treaſon, in the higheſt degree.

After this, his thoughts were altogether taken up, in diſpoſing of himſelf to die like a Chriſtian.

                  <p>TO pardon every one, is a cruelty more dangerous then to pardon no one; this only injureth the nocent, but that the innocent, ſeeing it expoſeth all men to great misfortunes. This only deſtroyeth particular families, whereas that is commonly the occaſion of the breaking out again of civil Wars, which were thought to have been quite extinguiſhed by Clemency, but do then indanger the abſolute ruine of a whole Kingdom, by their ſecond eruptions. Now amongſt thoſe many which deſerve to be chaſtiz'd, the chief heads of a Revolt, ought to be puniſhed much rather then the hands and feet, which were but acceſſaries there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto: It is the order preſcribed by Juſtice, and in effect, it is more equitable to puniſh thoſe who are the original and true cauſes of evil, then thoſe who could hardly defend themſelves from following their violent motions. The greatneſſe of their qualities may not priviledge them from the puniſhment due to the hainouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of their Crimes, although the faults of common mean perſons are uſually pardon'd by the too too great indulgence of Magiſtrates. On the contrary, if at any time Ambition tranſporteth them into ſeditions, it likewiſe rendreth, them much more culpable, and conſequently more deſerving of puniſhment, then the leaſt and moſt obſcure perſons of the Kingdome. Their lapſes are not only equal and liable to the inflictions provided for other Subjects; but they are the more no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious, by how much their quality is more conſpicuous, becauſe their exorbitan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are of a more dangerous conſequence. Every one is more concern'd at the Eclipſes of the Sun, then thoſe of other Stars, becauſe ſuch are commonly attended by ſad events; ſo the crimes of the chief leading men in a Nation, are more to be regarded, becauſe their effects are more to be feared then thoſe of private men. The revolt of a mean Gentleman, is ſeldom capable to raiſe any great troubles in
<pb n="516" facs="tcp:56802:264"/>a Kingdom, but that of a Governour of a Province, or ſome chief perſon in the State cannot happen, without carrying great misfortunes along with it.</p>
                  <p>It is great Prudence in ſuch occaſions, to follow the councel, give by <hi>Thra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibulus</hi> to <hi>Periander,</hi> who ſent his Ambaſſadours to him, deſiring to be inform'd how he might happily govern his State: He carried them out into a large field, and diſcourſing to them of things indifferent, he cut of the higheſt ears of Corn, and then told them they ſhould acquaint their Maſter, with what they had ſeen him do, and how that was the beſt advice he could give him: <hi>Periander</hi> underſtood the meaning, and well concluded, that the only means to rule in quiet, was to cut off their heads, who might any ways trouble the State, and that Prince who follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not this Rule, when Juſtice requireth it, ſhall quickly find himſelf neceſſitated to ſuſtain the inconveniences of a Civil War. He who cheriſheth that Serpent which hath formerly ſtung him, expoſeth himſelf to the danger of a ſecond wound; and that Prince who once pardoneth the Ring-leader of a Rebellion, giveth life to a man, who may in time find an opportunity to raiſe a ſecond and more dangerous revolt, becauſe he may then better provide in prevenſion of thoſe evils which cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed his firſt ruine, whereas him death were a <hi>Quietus eſt.</hi> In a word, a Prince cannot but be commended for ſacrificing the life of a Rebel, to the quiet of his State.</p>

The Queen-Mother in particular, who had ever a great kindneſſe for the Duke of <hi>Montmorency,</hi> was in great fear for him, leſt the King ſhould make him the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of his Juſtice, for an example to others, as he had well deſerved. But Father <hi>Chanteloupe,</hi> who never wanteth remedies, at leaſt imaginary ones, for all acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, which do never ſo little provoke the Queen-Mothers paſſion, knowing that in Womens affairs, a Man is ever acceptable to them, in caſe he do but ſooth them in their affections, adviſed to ſurprize Madam <hi>de Combalet,</hi> and to bring her away to <hi>Bruxels;</hi> aſſuring themſelves, that having that Lady in their hands, who being the Cardinals Neece, and indued with ſuch qualities, as rendred her not only the moſt amiable, but the moſt deſerving perſon of the Court, was the object of his affections, that grand Miniſter would be compelled to obtain his pardon, for very fear leſt ſhe might find ſome harſh uſage, in caſe they ſhould put him to death. I may ſafely ſay, that the important ſervices of this favourable <hi>Genius,</hi> ought to have hindred the Queen-Mother, who knew him better then any other perſon what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, from conſenting to ſo unjuſt a deſign when it was firſt propoſed, for that conſideration alone, ought to have been an inviolable ſecurity to all his relations. But I will only ſay, the merit of that Lady was ſufficient of it ſelf, to oblige her to puniſh the Authors of ſuch raſh Councels, ſeeing ſhe is the Ornament and Glory of the Court, the honour of her Sex, a miracle of Virtues, and repleniſhed with exemplary Piety, not preciſe or diſagreeable, but attractive and taking; that ſhe doth (as it were) force a reſpective love in the Souls of all who behold the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Graces wherewith Heaven hath inriched her. But what reaſon was there, or indeed what reaſon could there be alledged to expiate the Duke <hi>de Montmorency's</hi> Crimes of Rebellion, upon a perſon whoſe acquired Vertues and innate Graces did oblige all Man-kind to pay her all imaginable honour and reſpect? Yet Paſſion having no eys to behold any truth which thwarts it; the Queen-Mother approved of <hi>Chanteloup's</hi> deſign, thought good to command the execution thereof at <hi>Beçan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>çon,</hi> writ unto ſundry Gentlemen whom ſhe intruſted, to aſſiſt the attempt, and

                  <p>ALthough beſides the injuſtice, it be an impudent boldneſſe, to injure Ladies of Quality and Honour, their Sex and Merit having ever ſecured them from all outrages, even in the hotteſt times of War, yet they receive no little glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry by pardoning ſuch rudeneſſe, if any be offered unto them. It is not the ſame thing in matter of forgiving wrongs, between private perſons and Princes, the latter being often obliged to follow the rigor of the Laws for the good of his State; whereas it is alwaies honourable for the former to forgive, eſpecially for Ladies, ſweetneſſe being a becomming Vertue of their Sex, although cruelty be a uſual in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredient in their conſtitutions. It is a moſt aſſured mark of Generoſity, then to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don injuries when one is able to revenge them. None but great Courages are touched with pitty; for thoſe who have ſhewed themſelves moſt inhumane, they only convert their Anger into Compaſſion, whereas they might juſtly enough take exceptions againſt them. <hi>Julius Caeſar,</hi> whoſe Vertue is not only notorious, but admired by all the World, was hardly to be moved to anger by the common fry of men, thinking them (belike) beneath his Paſſion, and too inconſiderable to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet him.

Kings themſelves are not more conſiderable for their Juſtice then their Clemency. Many there have been ingenious enough in puniſhing the guilty, but few are the examples of Clemency, it being rarely ſeen, that a grand patience cohabits with a Soveraign power; though the Sun be the moſt worthy Ornament of the Heavens, yet he is only reſpected by men, in regard of his benigne influences, which he ſendeth amongſt them; and true it is, that let a Lady be never ſo great, yet nothing can ſo much recommend her, as Clemency, eſpecially ſuch as carrieth her on, to do good unto them who have made themſelves unworthy thereof, by their indeavours to do her a miſchief.</p>

The little aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of ſafety which <hi>Monſieur</hi> foreſaw in <hi>Lorrain,</hi> did ſomewhat touch him, but the <hi>Sieur de Puy-Laurens,</hi> inſinuating to him how eaſily he might retire from <hi>Nancy</hi> to <hi>Bruxelles,</hi> in caſe his Majeſty ſhould ſeem to incline towards any expedition againſt <hi>Lorrain;</hi> in conſideration of him, and how that he would alwaies be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived there, his birth rendring him conſiderable, ſwayed his former reſolutions, and made him incline to that ſide, ſo powerfull was his credit with him; although the reſt repreſented to him, that he would find leſſe ſecurity by caſting himſelf into the hands of the Spaniards, then in any other place whatever; that they might perchance entertain him with honour; but that it was to be feared, he would not long continue Maſter of his own liberty, or that he might have the freedom to get off when he ſhould moſt deſire it. The reſolution of departing being concluded, <hi>Monſieur</hi> went into <hi>Lorrain</hi> in <hi>November,</hi> and for the more ſpecious pretext of their relapſe, they preſumed to write unto the King, perſiſting to abuſe his name and pen; how that the preſervation of <hi>Monſieur to Montmorency's</hi> life, and the procuring of his liberty, having induc'd him to ſubmit to whatever his Majeſty was pleas'd to impoſe, the taking off of his head being a perſon ſo dear to him, was ſo publique an affront, and ſlight, that he could no longer indure it; and withall, that it was impoſſible he ſhould longer continue in <hi>France,</hi> without giving cauſe to ſuſpect, he had made his own accommodation with other intentions, then of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining that favour, of which he was ſtill fed with great hopes: Beſides that, he could expect little ſatisfaction for his own perſon, ſeeing his requeſts and intreaties had been ſo little conſiderable in the executing of him, whoſe life was equally dear to him, with his own, and whoſe death he could not digeſt without great diſhonor. This was the ſubſtance of the Letter, whereunto there need no other anſwer, but that the Duke of <hi>Montmorency</hi> having been condemned by one of the moſt famous Parliaments of the Kingdom, for a Crime which could not be let paſſe without pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, unleſſe to the very great detriment of the State, eſpecially after himſelf had ſent ſeven Couriers to aſſure his Majeſty of his fidelity, after he had conſpired
<pb n="519" facs="tcp:56802:265"/>with Forraigners to deſtroy the Kingdom, after he had almoſt totally raiſed one of the chiefeſt Provinces, after he had been taken in the head of an Army, with his ſword died with blood in his hand, actually fighting againſt his Majeſties ſervice, after he had ſomented diviſions in his Majeſties family, and committed ſeveral other enormities as hath been declared; there was little reaſon to expect his pardon, and as to the other part, that it was improbable his Highneſſe ſhould conſent to the Treaty made at <hi>Beziers,</hi> only in order to obtain <hi>Monſieur de Montmorency's</hi> par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, when as he was abſolutely forced by neceſſity to ſubmit thereunto, having not forces enough to defend himſelf. Such was the reply which the King ſent unto him, wherein he teſtified to the whole World, how he never offered any juſt cauſe to thoſe of his royal blood, to ſeparate themſelves from him, or to be deficient in paying thoſe reſpects, unto which nature and his Majeſties affection did not a little oblige them.</p>

                  <p>VVHatever refuſal a Prince receiveth from his King, yet he rendreth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf inexcuſable, if his Paſſion tranſport him beyond his duty: He ought to recollect unto his memory, how that no one, in a well-govern'd State can im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the Law on his Soveraign, but that every one ought to ſubmit his own private, to his Princes Will. There are in a State, as in the Soul, ſuperiour and inferiour powers; and as the law of Nature hath ordained the weaker faculties give way un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſtronger and more able; ſo the Grandees of a Kingdom are obliged to ſtoop under the Laws of their Supream Prince, and to comply with his Will, without any the leaſt contradiction. What but Death can be expected from that body whoſe particular Members refuſe to execute thoſe Offices which are injoyned them by the Head? And what can be looked for from a State, where the Nobles flie out, and deny obedience to the Soveraigns Decrees? This were repugnant to the Order of Juſtice, nothing but misfortunes could attend it. It matters not whether they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies meet with their particular ſatisfaction, ſeeing a King is obliged to intend the publick good, not the requeſts of his Grandees. The Sun which preſideth in the Heavens doth not alwaies ſhine and ſmile on the earth, as we would have him, but as he is obliged in order to the univerſal good, ſo he withdraweth himſelf at cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain hours, and who ſo ſhould be diſcontented herewith, would it not appear un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable? Are not Kings ſometimes neceſſitated in conſideration of their State, to with-hold their favours, and to deny their pardon for certain crimes, which otherwiſe they would not ſcruple to grant? And were it not too too little ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, upon ſuch occaſions for a Subject to fall off, and to flie out into extremities? Reaſons of State are often ſo viſibly apparent, that there need nothing but a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of paſſion to behold and force a confeſſion, that it were imprudence not to proſecute them; but admit there were no ſuch evincing arguments, yet no man can juſtly complain againſt his Soveraign, in regard reaſons of State are for the moſt part kept ſecret. Antiquity did obſerve a cuſtome very myſterious, which was this, they placed a <hi>Sphynx</hi> over the Portals of their Temples, to teach the people they ought not to enter they but with ſubmiſſions, ſuch as ſhould as it were lock up their bold curioſities, from inquiring into the myſteries which they adored, it being more proper humbly to reverence divine things, then to pry into them with a needleſſe Inquiſition. I could wiſh the like Statues were placed at the Gates of our Kings Pallaces, to teach men of all conditions, to receive their Commands and Laws with obedience, cheerfulneſſe and ſubmiſſion, without examining the reaſons of them, which ought by them, though unknown, to be eſteemed for good and juſt, eſpecially ſeeing at laſt, their Will ought to be a Law to all their Subjects, and that it is a kind of Rebellion, as it were, to contradict it. For my part, I think it likewiſe a great prudence not to inquire into the motives, reaſons or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducements of their Wills, becauſe Miniſters might thereby be obliged to diſcover Truths, not proper to be known, as happened at <hi>Florence,</hi> in the time of <hi>Coſime
<pb n="520" facs="tcp:56802:266"/>de Medicis,</hi> who being extreamly preſſed by a Florentine to tell him the reaſon, why he had refuſed him an Office whoſe Predeceſſor had been hang'd for ill diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging it; at laſt told him, after many importunities, that he did it, becauſe he feared he would likewiſe be hanged as the former, letting him ſee by this anſwer, how he knew him to be like enough for his wickedneſſe to dance in the ſame rope. So a Prince expreſſing any diſcontent for puniſhing of any Grandee, who had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged him in a Rebellion, and earneſtly preſſing to know the reaſon of ſuch rigor, might be anſwered, that it was done for fear he might draw him a ſecond time into the ſame ſnares. It is alwaies ſafer for Princes to diſſemble their diſcontents, and cheerfully to ſubmit unto their Soveraigns Will, then to expreſſe any diſlikes which only ſerve to bring them into diſtruſt, to raiſe ſuſpicions and ſpies upon their acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and to hinder their receiving of any more favours; whereas by their ſeeming to be well ſatisfied, they preſerve themſelves in their Soveraigns good opinion, and in a condition to reap abundance of advantages: And <hi>Guichardine</hi> in his advices ſaith, that he had oftentimes obtained his ends, by diſſembling his diſcontents with thoſe, who elſe would never have ſerved his turn, and that he had receiv'd ſuch friendſhips and favours from them, as he could not have expected had he diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red any diſlike.</p>

                  <p>ALthough Biſhops by their places are raiſed to an high degree of honour, yet they wrong themſelves if they think they are exempted from their Kings Authority, ſeeing the Popes have in their writings as <hi>Gelaſius</hi> to the Emperor <hi>Anaſtatius, Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lagius</hi> to <hi>Childebert,</hi> one of our firſt Kings, and St <hi>Gregory</hi> to the Emperor <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritius,</hi> acknowledged themſelves depending upon their authority. It is moreover true, that Biſhops are more eſpecially obliged, beyond any other Subjects, to live in an exemplary Loyalty, and by their indeavours to preſerve the people in peace. Upon their promotion to that ſpiritual dignity, the take a new Oath of Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, which as it were a ſecond Chain, tieth them to the yoke of obedience, but admitting that were not ſo, yet the Miniſters of the Church conforming themſelves to the temper of their Mother, which is a ſpirit of peace, are bound to appeaſe and pacifie the people when they are tumultuouſly given, and much more not to blow the Coals of their diſſention. <hi>Savanarola</hi> was exceedingly condemned for exaſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating an inſurrection in <hi>Florence,</hi> againſt the <hi>Medicis</hi> when he publiquely preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that it was Gods Will and Pleaſure to have a popular Government eſtabliſhed, to the intent the chief of the City might have no longer power to diſpoſe of the ſafety of ſome, and the Libertie of others. They who are ſo inconſiderate as to follow ſuch ſedicious tracts, do render themſelves the more unworthy of their cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, by how much the Church doth abhor War and Blood. We ſhould think it very ſtrange, if Heaven which was created by the eternal Providence of God, to inlighten the World with its ſtars, to produce nouriſhments, by its influences for the preſervation of all creatures, to enamel the earth with all ſorts of Flowers, and to overſpread it with a thouſand kinds of Fruits, ſhould in a ſudden alter its nature, and only fill us with darkneſſe, terrifie us with Thunders, and load the Earth with Briars and Thorns: And would it not be more wonderfull to behold (the Son of God having not more ſtrictly charged his Diſciples with any one thing, then to
<pb n="527" facs="tcp:56802:267"/>be obedient, and to preſerve that Peace which he had brought unto Man-kind) Biſhops, their Succeſſors, indeavouring to their utmoſt to deſtroy and die the land with blood, to divert people from their duties, to arm them againſt their lawfull Prince, and by their power of Souls to ruine that Authority, which Chriſt their Maſter hath given to their Soveraigns? This were abſolutely repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to the Orders by him eſtabliſhed, and directly oppoſite to the Laws to them preſcribed. If any of them ſhould be ſo forgetfull of their duties, the Miniſters of State are the more obliged to puniſh them, in regard the reverence wherewith they are eſteemed, and the opinion which men have of their ſanctity and Doctrine, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth their example of a more dangerous conſequence, and their diſcourſes more powerfull to perſwade, whatever they are diſpoſed to inculcate. For this very reaſon was it, that <hi>Giles</hi> Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Rheimes,</hi> was depoſed by <hi>Childebert,</hi> that <hi>Pretextatus</hi> was deprived of the Arch-Biſhoprick of <hi>Rouen.</hi> In the time of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dery, that <hi>Theodor</hi> loſt that of <hi>Arles</hi> by the command of <hi>Clovis;</hi> upon this ſcore it was, that <hi>Lewis</hi> the Debonair, forced the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Milan</hi> to give an account of his diſloyalties, <hi>Abon</hi> Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Rheims, Volsphod</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mone,</hi> and <hi>Theodolph</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Orleans,</hi> accomplices in the Conſpiracy of <hi>Bernard</hi> King of <hi>Italy.</hi> Did not <hi>Hugh Capet</hi> cauſe <hi>Arnoul</hi> convicted of Falſhood and Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to be drawn from the Sea of <hi>Rheims.</hi> It is the ancient politique cuſtom of <hi>France,</hi> a Right belonging to our Kings, and which Pope <hi>Zachary</hi> himſelf advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed <hi>Pepin</hi> to put in execution, without any ſcruple, when and ſo often as occaſion ſhould require.

                  <p>IT is very dangerous to commit the Government of a Province to a Grandee who hath once had his hand in a Revolt, who hath declared his diſcontent, or hath any pretence to the place in his charge. The diſloyalty which ingaged him in any faction, rendreth him more deſerving of puniſhment then preferment, and the leaſt chaſtiſement which can be inflicted on him, is to deprive him of all imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, it being a thing of great concern, exemplarily to chaſtize thoſe Governors which are guilty of ſuch offences. The puniſhment inflicted on them, ſerveth for an example to others, and keepeth them in their duties, whereas impunity incoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth others to run into the ſame faults. Beſides, he who hath once had the impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to imbark himſelf in a rebellious deſign, will be ever ready to put it in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, when a fair opportunity invites him. Great ſickneſſes adminiſter ſuſpici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of relapſes; and the wiſeſt Kings, having once ſeen a Grandee fall off from his Allegiance, have ever diſtruſted him, and never afforded him the opportunity of doing the leaſt evill. Small things may be hazarded, but amongſt ſuch, the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of a Province, one of the moſt important charges of a State may not be reckoned. It is likewiſe equally dangerous, to truſt a Grandee who hath once ſhewed himſelf to be diſcontented; it were to be ignorant of the uſual conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which attend great mens diſcontents to intruſt the Government of a Province with them. There is not any thing more natural to a man who is either provoked or beleeveth himſelf injured, then to ſtudy revenge, and to uſe his utmoſt indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to retort it. To give ſuch a man authority, were to impower him to ſatisfie his Paſſion, which attended with weakneſſe would be ineffectual. The great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments of the Marſhal <hi>de Marillac,</hi> did only ſerve to render him the more culpable, neither indeed may any thing elſe be reaſonably ſuſpected from thoſe men that give themſelves over to a male-contented humor.</p>
                  <p>But above all, it is a moſt ſignal imprudence to commit the government of great Provinces, to ſuch as have any pretenſions unto them, how old or ancient ſoever.

How dangerous is it then to beſtow it upon ſuch who perſwade themſelves it is their brith-right? If Ambition be to be feared, though without a pretext, how much more is it then to be ſuſpected, when there is ſome apparent juſtice for the ground of it? If the Province be divided into parties, he need then onely adhere to the ſtrongeſt, and then much may be done; but if it be united, he may poſſibly ingage the whole in revolt, if he once get the affections of the people, which is eaſily brought to paſſe if a man deſigns it, and makes it his buſineſſe.</p>

His Majeſty impatient to ſee him, went up into his Chamber by a back-ſtair, which was the nearer way, whil'ſt this grand Miniſter hearing of his comming, went down the great ſtairs with more diligence then his ſtrength would well bear; ſo that inſtead of meeting, that agility which is natural unto the King, cauſed him to go down again, and after ſome hindrance by the preſſe of the Nobility, they at laſt met in the Caſtle Court. The Cardinal approaching his Majeſty caſt himſelf at his feet, but the King preſently raiſing him with one hand, imbraced him with the other ſo tenderly, that moſt of the beholders could not forbear tears of joy, each one profeſſing that it was impoſſible to ſee teſtimonies of a more cordial favour from a Maſter or more reſpectfull affection from a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant. Such were the ſentiments both of one and the other, that at firſt they were ſpeechleſſe; but having recovered the liberty of their tongues, the King told him, that he received as much joy to ſee him in ſo good plight, as the enemies of <hi>France</hi> had at the falſe report of his death, that this teſtimony of their hatred was a new inſtigation to augment that eſteem he ever had on his ſervices, and that he ſhould not recommend any thing with more earneſtneſſe unto him, then the being care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of his own health. The Cardinal anſwered, he deſired not to live but to ſerve his Majeſty, that he dayly begg'd of God that his ſervices might be the boundaries of his life, and that his health would ſoon be recruited, ſince he found his Majeſty in ſo good condition.

                  <p>EXtraordinary honours are juſtly due to great Miniſters of State, as the only luſtre of their fair attempts. The joy of their return from a long voyage, hath often invited the people to go forth and meet them, and to render them all imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable reſpects. Thus <hi>Pompey</hi> returning, after he had been ſome time detained at <hi>Naples</hi> by a dangerous ſickneſſe, the greateſt part of the Romans marched out of the City, the ways, the Port and the ſtreets were ſo full, that there was hardly any Paſſage. Some were offering ſacrifice for his health, others feaſting and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king merry in ſign of joy; ſome march'd before him with Torches, and others ſtrewd the way with flowers. Thus likewiſe <hi>Scipio</hi> returning from <hi>Germany</hi> where he atchieved glorious exploits, every one long'd to ſee him return triumphing to <hi>Rome,</hi> that they might render him the glory which he deſerved, yet becauſe the Triumph was not a cuſtom to be granted to ſuch who were neither Pro-conſuls nor Magiſtrates, the Senate could not reſolve to grant him that honour neither did he deſire it; but on the other ſide, it is obſerved in Hiſtory, that there never was ſo great a concourſe of people in <hi>Rome,</hi> as at his return either to ſee him, or to teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie their acknowledgements they had of his ſervices by their going out to receive him. I will paſſe a little further, and add that juſtice and prudence, do oblige Kings to joyn with their people on ſuch occaſions, and ſo render extraordinary honours unto their Miniſters, either for the more ample acknowledgement of the ſervices they have receiv'd from them or for the more countenancing of them in the execution of their commands, or to incourage others to be affectionate to their ſervice. Acknowledgement is a Virtue requiſite both in Prince and people, and ſeeing the ſervice done to a State is of no leſſe advantage to a Prince, then to his Subjects, he is no leſſe obliged to teſtifie his gratitude, if theſe proofs of his good will confer a great honour on thoſe who have ſerved him, himſelf receives no mean advantage thereby; becauſe the Nobility who are extream ſenſible of honour, will not then ſticke at any thing which may tend to his ſervice, and the Agents of his Will have more credit and authority to execute his Commands. It there any thing more glorious (ſaid the great Chancellor of <hi>Thiery,</hi> King of the Goths) then
<pb n="522" facs="tcp:56802:269"/>to deſerve praiſe and approbation, who by reaſon of their Soveraignty are not to be ſuſpected of Flattery? Surely no, the honour which they confer upon any one proceeding from the favourable Judgements which they give of his acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and their authority permitting not them to be guilty of adulation. Which if true (as doubtleſſe it is) there is not any thing then which doth more incourage Nobility, then the glory wherewith Princes honour their ſervants, nor is there any thing which doth more impower a Miniſter then the carreſſes which his Prince be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoweth upon him; they confer no leſſe credit upon their Miniſters, then their ſtamps do on their monies.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Tiberius</hi> one of the wiſeſt Roman Emperours did well underſtand the import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of this maxime in the honours which he beſtowed on the Conſuls thoſe chief Miniſters of his Will, when he went to receive them at the Gate of his Palace, at ſuch time as they came to ſup with him, and waited on them back again when they took their leaves.</p>

                  <p>IT being of great concernment to prevent the concluſion of any Treaty be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Spaniard and Hollander, his Majeſty bent his chief care to take or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der accordingly: Indeed it was at that time a matter of ſo great concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that the Fortunes of moſt Princes of <hi>Europe</hi> ſeemed to depend there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon; and ſo much the more circumſpection ought his Majeſty to uſe, in regard of the Procedures of the Spaniard, who had contrary to form permitted the States of the Provinces obeying the Low Countries, to negotiate the particulars of the Treaty with the Hollanders, and the advantagious proffers by him made to obtain it, gave great cauſe to look about, leſt they might be induced to aſſent thereunto: Neither was it unknown, how that he deſigned (the League once concluded) to aſſiſt the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> with an Army, as alſo the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> to invade <hi>France,</hi> and to ſend the reſidue of his Forces unto the Emperour, the better to curb the <hi>Swede,</hi> and to proſecute thoſe advantages he had lately obtained againſt them. The Cardinal who pierceth into the depth of their pretenſions, was indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious to fortifie his Majeſty in the reſolution of preventing the concluſion of that Treaty; in order to which, he likewiſe made him certain Propoſals well-becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming the acuteneſſe of his more then humane ſpirit: He committed the manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of that negotiation unto the <hi>Sieur</hi> of <hi>Charnace,</hi> who was newly returned from <hi>Germany,</hi> where he had given ſuch ſundry proofs of his prudence amongſt divers Princes, that his well-acquitting himſelf of that imployment, could not be any ways ſuſpected. I ſhall not ſay any thing concerning his inſtructions, onely this, the Orders contained in them were ſo many incomparable effects of the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal, to whom nothing was impoſſible, but I ſhall paſſe on to the addreſſe which he uſed in the execution of it, ſo happy I ſay it was that he obtained all that could be deſired. After having paſs'd the uſual Complements in his Majeſties behalf to the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> the Governours and Deputies of the States of <hi>Holland;</hi> he told them that his Majeſty was very ſolicitous of ſuch a League, which may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude their differences in an happy peace, but not finding any likelihood thereof in that now propoſed unto them he was pleaſed out of his affection and good will to
<pb n="528" facs="tcp:56802:270"/>their intereſts to ſend him unto them to communicate ſuch thoughts unto them as he conceived moſt advantagious to their Common-wealth. He beſeeched them to conſider that the eagerneſſe alone wherewith the Spaniards proſecuted it, was enough to render it ſuſpected, that Counſels entertained with heat by an enemy, connot be but with deſign to advantage himſelf, that it was viſible the diſorder of his affairs was the onely cauſe he ſo paſſionately proſecuted it, that the extremity to which he was reduced being aſſaulted over all the <hi>Indies,</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> in the Low-countries unable to furniſh out new Levies or monies neceſſary for his ſecurity, did not a little incline him thereunto: He further repreſented to them, how it had alwaies been eſteemed for a matter of great concernment, not to give an enemy breath when he is upon the point of falling, and made it eaſie to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, that for them to make a Peace with the Spaniard in this his low condition, would be the more prejudicial to them, he having hardly any other ſhift to make himſelf conſiderable, than the reporting of this Treaty to be concluded; neither was he backward to repreſent unto them, that admitting theſe his reaſons ſhould be invalid, yet they did abuſe themſelves, if they beleeved that the Treaty could include their Peace in it, in regard of the Spaniards obſtinate reſolution of never relinquiſhing his pretended Soveraignty over their Countries, a reſolution which he hath ever proteſted againſt the Decree of the 16. of <hi>July,</hi>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 1588 which declared <hi>Philip</hi> the ſecond to have loſt all his right over them, and how that after he had treated with them as between Soveraign and Soveraign by concluding that Treaty, 1609, yet he could not forbear his ill intention during the 12 years that it laſted, and which is more ſet <hi>Berkins</hi> Chancellour of <hi>Brabant</hi> in the year 1621. to ſoſicite them to return unto the obedience, as he was pleaſed to ſay of their natural Prince that in vain they did perſwade themſelves the Councel of <hi>Spain</hi> would relinquiſh his pretenſions; ſeeing on the contrary, upon every occaſion he hath been ready to drive on his pretences both upon them and others, and that admitting the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſhould be once concluded, yet they muſt ever be renewing of it; and in effect that nothing would be obtained thereby, but the loſſe of a fair opportunity, whiles the Spaniards were reduc'd to ſo low an ebb. He moreover, forced them to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, that the Treaty being uncapable of producing their Peace, the State of their affairs, and good of their Country did not oblige them in any reſpect to deſire it, that their Provinces were never more flouriſhing, that Learning, Husbandry, Trade and whatever Peace maketh elſewhere to flouriſh, were with them freely exerciſed in times of War, that their Diſciplines were ſo carefully improved, that the Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians could never with ſo much reaſon repreſent an armed <hi>Pallas</hi> as they might, that their Paſtures and Plains, were not in the leaſt troubled with the Souldiers; that their Plow-ſhares were as bright as their Pikes and Swords; and that the noiſe of the Cannons did not at all hinder their Traffick, as the Province of <hi>Zealand,</hi> and thoſe others which are moſt addicted unto Merchandize have declared by their averſions to this Treaty. Some private ones of <hi>Spain</hi> might paradventure object that admitting the State of their Provinces might not compel them to a ceſſation of Arms for ſome years! yet it could not however but be advantagious to them, becauſe the Flemings and Walloons, would in that interim forget their warlike ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes, and that the Swedes and Proteſtants would ſo weaken the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> that there would be no more cauſe of fear; but he eaſily convinced them of the vanity of their hopes, and repreſented to them, how little reaſon there was to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve that the want of accompt during the Treaty, would <hi>effeminat</hi> the Flemings and Walloons, becauſe the Spaniard would not leave them idle, but find employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments enough for them in other parts: and that on the contrary, undoubtedly the Spaniard would tranſport all his force into <hi>Germany,</hi> which he had formerly entertained in the Low-Countries; by which means he would force thoſe Princes who counterpoiſed his Power, to receive the Law from him, and to lay down their Arms, and which once effected, that he would bring back his Forces from <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi> recruited with a far greater ſtrength, which had for many years ſupported the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria;</hi> and that it would not then be very difficult to reduce <hi>Holland</hi>
                     <pb n="529" facs="tcp:56802:270"/>unto ſlavery. This Anſwer was the more to be conſidered, in regard it was ſo convincing, contrary to the preſervation of their State and Liberty; nor did he forget to add that on the contrary, it was not a little important to foreſee how much this Treaty would undoubtedly weaken the united Provinces, both in regard of the Diviſion it would raiſe among them, or the diſ-uſe of Arms, and their Traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fique in the <hi>Indies,</hi> ſo far was it from any likelyhood of encreaſing their power; that it was but vain to hope for it without reliquiſhing the Trade of both the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies;</hi> the Spaniard being not ſo indiſcreet as to condiſcend thereunto after the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving ſo great detriment as he had from them; but that in caſe they concluded it, they would thereby blaſt their faireſt hopes, diminiſh the ſtock of their riches, and cut off their right hand, their power by Sea, without which they were not conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable among their neighbors: As to what concern'd the diſcontinuation of the War, he freely told them that States preſerve not themſelves but by ſuch means as have ſerved to eſtabliſh them, as natural bodies ſubſiſt not but by the ſame things as are in their firſt compoſitions; and that they did in vain ſtrive to cauſe their State to flouriſh in peace, which had received it's birth and being from War, and which could not but by War be preſerved in its preſent ſplendor. He layd before them that peace would be abſolutely prejudicial to them, as experience had evin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in the late 12 years Treaty, during which the Spaniſh Plots, Gold, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſes had wrought them a 1000 times more damage then all their open force could ever do; beſides, the Souldiers laying by their uſual exerciſes, would looſe much of their valor, by which till then they had obtained ſuch ſignal advantages, and being not ignorant how powerful impreſſions truth maketh, when it is ſeconded by glory; that he might excite them, he proclaimed aloud, that there never yet was Common-wealth, ſo like the Roman, as that of the Hollander; adding withall, that if that had receiv'd ſuch continual growth from War, as it had not in ſeven hundred years from it's firſt foundation untill <hi>Auguſtus</hi> time, but only twice ſhut up the Temple of <hi>Janus,</hi> ſo it had loſt it ſelf by an unactive Peace<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that nothing but the like misfortune could befall them, when once they ſhould relinquiſh their exerciſe of Arms. Nor did he conceal from them that in caſe they ſhould then conclude the Treaty, their Republique would totally diſcredit it ſelf with its Allies, not only becauſe they would no more eſteem their conduct after they ſhould fee them run on to ſo diſadvantagious a reſolution; but the more, in regard they did in ſuch a conjuncture of time as would be very prejudicial to their neighbours, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially thoſe of <hi>Germany,</hi> who finding themſelves thereby diſ-obliged, could not for the future be ſo aſſiſting to them, as formerly they had been. He beſeeched them to remember that a State which injureth its Allies, injureth it ſelf; and that in fine, if after ſo many victories they ſhould humonr the Spaniard in his paſſionate deſire of the Treaty, there could no other eſteem be had of them but ſuch as <hi>Caeſar</hi> had of <hi>Pompey</hi> when he was well handled by him at <hi>Duras</hi> but not proſecuted, who openly ſaid, <hi>Pompey</hi> knows not how to overcome. This was the ſubſtance of moſt of the reaſons no leſſe judicious then powerfull, which the <hi>Sieur de Charnace</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed at divers meetings had with the Miniſters of <hi>Holland</hi> to prevent the Treaty, ſo dextrouſly did he manage them, ſo vigorouſly and with ſuch addreſſe that he eaſily convinc'd the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> who for ſome particular intereſt was indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent well inclined thereunto, and perſwaded the Governours and Deputies of the States to confeſſe, that there was no more to be thought but how to force the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard by Arms to an abſolute relinquiſhing his pretenſions over their country, in a Treaty of Peace, wherein all the Princes their Allies ſhould be included to oblige him the more firmly to obſerve the conditions thereof, neither ſatisfied with this reſolution, he aſſured them according as he was commanded, that they might the more readily take the field; how the King would cauſe a ſuccour of then or twelve thouſand men, to be ſent unto them from the <hi>Swede,</hi> who accordingly were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted unto them about <hi>Auguſt</hi> by the Collonell <hi>Melander;</hi> ſo that about the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of <hi>Spring,</hi> the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> beſieged <hi>Rimberg</hi> and carried it, and ſent Count <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Naſſau</hi> to the confines of <hi>Flanders</hi> to divert the Spaniard.</p>

                  <head>Politique Obſervation.</head>
                  <p>VVHatever terrour the horrour of Arms do naturally carry with them, yet do I think that Peace ought not to be concluded but on four occaſions. The firſt is, when there is a juſt ground to believe that it will carry things to an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagious Peace, for ſeeing War ought not to be undertaken but in order to the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of a good Peace, and that the end is ever to be preferred before the means, it cannot be doubted but that Arms are to be layed by when there are any more likely means to obtain it: The Olive Trees, true Symbols of Peace, bearing fruit uſe-full for mans life are doubtleſſe more to be eſteemed then Lawrels which only put forth unprofitable berries; and the great advantages which are obtained by Peace, are more to be eſteemed then the greateſt glory acquired to Wars. I have formerly ſufficiently proved this truth, nor wil I longer dwel upon it. The ſecond is, when the eexpences and incommodities of War do in force a Treaty. There is not any cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage which is not obliged to ſubmit to the law of neceſſity, and the impoſſibility of proſecuting an enterprize, how juſt and glorious ſoever, hath exempted the greateſt Princes from any blame. War ought not to be continued but to obtain Victory, which when there is no likelihood of amidſt the ruines of a Country, it is then much more expedient to make a League then totally to fall. The Gods themſelves, ſaith an Ancient, do ſubmit to neceſſity; there is nothing ſtronger then it, and the greateſt vertue muſt ſtoop to it, neither is any valour or prudence obliged to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it. The third is, when it may reaſonably be hoped that the League will weaken the enemy, whom at that time we deſpair to overcome, and that either by ſowing ſome diviſion among them, or by effeminating them by the diſcontinuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their warlike exerciſe. The wiſe Pilot doth not obſtinately withſtand the Tempeſt, when he ſeeth his Veſſel extreamly bruiſed, but letting fall the Sails, run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth into ſome ſhelter where he may ride at Anchor, untill ſuch time as the fury of the Winds be abated that he may put to Sea again: Thus is it an effect of diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to lay by the Sword for ſome time when an enemy is ſo potent that there is no likelihood of any thing but loſſe by the proſecution of the War. The fourth is that a League ought to be concluded, when it will afford the means of taking more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage. War is a kind of ſickneſſe in the State, and as ſick people are permitted to reſt, the better to recover their loſt ſtrength; ſo I think it cannot but be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable in a Prince to ſurceaſe the War for ſome time, the better to refreſh his forces, to recruit them, and to raiſe monies neceſſary to maintain them. If on ſuch occaſions it be reaſonable to conclude a Treaty, it will then be very improper to conclude it, when a Country is flouriſhing, and raiſeth more advantages by War then Peace. Moſt certain it is, that ſometimes ſo it happens, and <hi>Hannibal</hi> well knew it, when ſeeing the Carthaginians weep upon the firſt demand of the Tribute granted to the Romans, at the end of the ſecond Punick War, he reproached them, as <hi>Livy</hi> obſerveth it. Ye had much more reaſon, quoth he, to have weep'd when you were prohibited to War againſt ſtrangers, that was the would which killed you. The Lacedemonians and the Romans were not ignorant of it, it being upon this ground that they would never diſcontinue the uſe of Arms, unleſſe when Fortune deſigning the ruine of their Empires, perſwaded them to taſte the ſweets of Idleneſſe, which opening the door to delight and luxury, might in a little time dul their courages, and make them eaſily conquered by their enemies. This if true, among moſt States it is certainly much more apparent in relation to thoſe who have received their Beings from War, nor can be preſerved but by War. It were likewiſe great imprudence to make a League which might afford an enemy time to recruit. Had King <hi>Perſeus</hi> known the condition of the Romans, he would have been more wary in concluding that Peace with them which he did, as <hi>Livy</hi> recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, which gave their Ambaſſadours accaſion at their return to laugh at him, for having ſuffered himſelf to be ſurprized by them; for he had then ready all proviſions neceſſary for the War, of which the Romans were altogether unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided;
<pb n="531" facs="tcp:56802:271"/>ſo that concluding a League he gave them time to ſettle their affairs and take an advantage upon him; beſides all theſe conſiderations, if a League doth not at leaſt ſerve to obtain an happy peace, it cannot but be eſteemed for diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious. For what reaſon can there be to deprive ones ſelf of power, and to give a weakned enemy leave and leiſure to re-inforce himſelf; when there is not an aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance that it will end in a peace of uſe and profit? So to proceed were ſome kind of blindneſſe, neither can any one ſo act, unleſſe an enemy to his own intereſt.</p>

                  <p>IF his Majeſty ſhewed any thing of Prudence in preventing the concluſion of any Treaty between the Spaniard and the Hollanders, he diſcovered no leſſe courage in his indeavour to re-eſtabliſh the Elector of <hi>Treves,</hi> in the reſt of thoſe places which his enemies had uſurped from him, <hi>Fumay</hi> and <hi>Reveign,</hi> ſcituated on two Penniſula's upon the River Meuſe, had ever acknowledged him for their Soveraign Lord; but the Spaniard whom conveniency ſeemeth to intitle unto any places which they may maſter, had clapp'd a garriſon into them, deſigning to fortifie them, to ſecure the Commerce of that River, and withall to make ſome enterpriſe upon the Frontier of <hi>Champagne.</hi> The King could not put up ſuch an injury offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red unto the Elector, ſince he had taken him into his protection, but ordered the Marqueſs <hi>de St. Chaumont</hi> to march toward <hi>Meziers,</hi> with thoſe forces which he commanded in <hi>Champagne</hi> to diſlodge them. The <hi>Sieur de Chaſtelliers Barlort,</hi> and the <hi>Comte de la Suze,</hi> were made Marſhals <hi>de Camp,</hi> who comming to the Army marched directly away toward thoſe two places. His courage made him wiſh that he might find ſome oppoſition, whereby he might obtain the more glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to his Maſters Arms; but making his approaches he underſtood that the Spaniſh Gariſon, notwithſtanding all their Rodomontades had marched out the night be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore without ſound of Trumpet, ſo that inſtead of fighting, all he had to do, was to receive teſtimonies of the inhabitants joy, who acknowledging his Majeſty for their Protector, did willingly receive the Regiment of <hi>Champagne</hi> into <hi>Fumay,</hi> and that of <hi>Normandy</hi> into <hi>Reveign.</hi> The Marqueſs <hi>de St. Chaumont,</hi> finding himſelf obliged to remunerate their good will, by all the favours which he could do them in quartering of the Army, ſetled ſo good an Order amongſt the Souldiers, that they never took any thing without paying for it, but behaved themſelves with great moderation and courteſie. The Enemy did not then oblige him to be more active at that time, and indeed the ſeaſon of the year was ſuch, in regard of the Snows and Froſt, that he could not march without difficulty, ſo that his Majeſty ſent him Order to return, and to leave his Forces in Garriſon upon the Frontier. He returned to ſpend ſome time at the Fort, whereupon the 10th. of <hi>February,</hi> he and the <hi>Comte Briſſac</hi> were created Miniſters of State to ſerve his Majeſty in his Counſel, the Spaniards who never ſleep but when they have nothing to do, took the occaſion of his abſence to return into the Country of the Elector of <hi>Treves,</hi> and to do what they pleaſed; but the King, and the invitation of the Spring, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting his return, he carried the Army back again, and without much ado forced them to quit the Field. The next thing he reſolved, was to aſſault <hi>Freidembourg,</hi> upon which they had ſeized, whoſe Garriſon offered a thouſand violences to Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers, and the adjacent places. The <hi>Comte de la Suze</hi> commanded it to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted, and comming in perſon before it in the moneth of <hi>June,</hi> he ſummoned <hi>Machiniſter</hi> who commanded it for the <hi>Comte d'Embden,</hi> and upon refuſal of a ſurrender they provided to aſſault it. The Town was won with little reſiſtance, and the Caſtle forced within two daies after, there being not above three or four men ſlain on both parts. Thus the Country of <hi>Treves</hi> was totally reduced unto his Majeſty's Poſſeſſion; nevertheleſſe his Majeſty having only ſecured it for the

                  <head>The principal Obligations of him who taketh a Prince into Protection.</head>
                  <p>DOubtleſſe it is honourable for a great Prince to undertake the Protection of another, unable to ſubſiſt by his own force, but though it is honourable, yet it is not without care, if this protection be to his advantage, yet is he obliged to recover whatever is taken from him; and in fine, fairly to reſtore it. To leave him a prey to his enemies were a ſign of weakneſſe, or want of courage, or an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute breach of promiſe in the firſt aſſumption. He that for fear of the charge, the ſucceſſe of the War, or any other conſideration ſhall neglect it doth not only deprive himſelf of that honour which the quality of a Protector aſcribes unto him, but doth likewiſe cloath himſelf with ſhame. Moreover, what expences ſoever he is at on ſuch occaſions, yet he is obliged by Juſtice to reſtore all places into the hands of their natural Prince, he being only, as it were, a Depoſitary; and as the Laws of Depoſition do not permit the appropriating of any thing to ones ſelf, the reſtoring of them, will be as honourable, as the detaining of them will be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt. <hi>Ptolomy</hi> King of <hi>Egypt</hi> dying, committed his ſon heir to his Crowns, then a child, unto the protection of the Common-Wealth of <hi>Rome,</hi> who profeſſing a particular obſervation of their promiſes, were not deficient in reſigning the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom into his power upon his firſt being capable of Government. Thus <hi>Archa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius,</hi> ſeeing his ſon <hi>Theodoſius</hi> very young and unable to ſecure himſelf from the power of the Perſians, ſo played his Game with <hi>Indigertes</hi> their King, that he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook his protection; and by this means he tied up his Arms by delivering his ſon into his hands. <hi>Indigertes</hi> receiv'd the Tutillage as an honour, and diſcharg'd it with ſuch fidelity that he preſerved <hi>Theodoſius</hi> life and Empire. That I may let you ſee theſe latter ages want not the like examples, <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> King of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> leaving his ſon <hi>Charles</hi> but of twelve years age, requeſted <hi>Lewis</hi> the Twelfth by his Will to be his Guardian, and to take the Kingdom into his prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. The King accepted thereof, and in proſecution of his charge, was ſo punctually correſpondent to the Truſt <hi>Philip</hi> had repoſed in it, that he preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved his States againſt <hi>France</hi> it ſelf, nor would uſurp the leaſt whatever provocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons <hi>Maximilian</hi> gave him. In fine, notwithſtanding all reſtitutions or expences, which a King is obliged unto, yet ought he never to refuſe the protection of a Prince bordering upon his Countries; becauſe beſides the glory whereof he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prives himſelf, he inforceth the other to throw himſelf into the protection of ſome one as powerfull as himſelf, who may raiſe advantages by it, and peradventure to his prejudice.</p>

                  <head>The Embaſsie and Negotiation of the <hi>Sieur de Feuquieres,</hi> to the Queen of <hi>Swede,</hi> and the renewing the treaty of Alliance between the two Crowns.</head>
                  <p>THe Cardinal repreſenting unto the King how the affairs of <hi>Germany</hi> were no leſſe conſiderable the thoſe of <hi>Holland,</hi> his Majeſty reſolved to provide ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, and made choice of the <hi>Sieur de Feuquieres,</hi> to negotiate thoſe concerns with the Allies of this Crown. The experience this Gentleman had acquired in other conſiderable imployments, rendred him no leſſe deſerving of this, then the addreſſe and diſpatch which he ſhewed in proving thoſe Orders which were delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red unto him; and it was the more needfull to make uſe of ſuch a man as he was in this German affair, in regard it concerned the curbing in of the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi>'s Ambition, who were become very powerfull by uſurping the Proteſtant Princes States, who were feared by their neighbours, and would have been a terrour to <hi>France</hi> it ſelf, could the have proſecuted their advantages. His Orders were chiefly three; the firſt was, to teſtifie to <hi>Chriſtina</hi> Queen of <hi>Swede,</hi> daughter and heir to the late King in the perſon of the Chancellor <hi>Oxenſtern,</hi> and all the Princes of the League of <hi>Leipſic;</hi> what care his Majeſty took in their intereſt, the Paſſion he had to ſee them reſtored who had been deſpoiled of their Eſtates; and how rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy he was by aſſiſting them to afford them the means of ſecuring their late victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. The ſecond was, to re-unite them and confirm them in the reſolution of proſecuting the deſigns of the League by a new Treaty of Alliance. And the third was to take ſuch courſe for the management of the Wars, that their Armies might want nothing but might be alwaies ready for action. The Princes had reſolv'd about the end of the laſt year to hold a Diet a <hi>Hailbron</hi> upon <hi>Nekar,</hi> to conclude upon the affairs of the War by a common conſent, and there it was where the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of all was to be layed. The <hi>Sieur de Feuquieres</hi> took Poſt the fifth of <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruary,</hi> that he might the ſooner get thither; but the Cardinal knowing ſuch like Aſſemblies are commonly full of confuſion, unleſſe each of them in particular be prediſpoſed to reaſon, perſwaded his Majeſty to ſend him to the Courts of divers the chief among them, the better to inſinuate unto them how much it concern'd them to continue in Union. He receiv'd Orders accordingly, nor was it of ſmall conſideration, becauſe he could eaſilier diſpoſe them one by one, then in a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, nor was he defective of comming with the firſt unto <hi>Hailbron,</hi> to prevent thoſe whom he had not yet ſeen, and to confirm the others in their reſolutions; and being arrived, the firſt care he took was to teſtifie the ſingular and conſtant affection which his Majeſty had for the common good, and to aſſure them that they ſhould receive indubitable proofs of it upon any fair occaſion. The next thing he did was to illuſtrate what great aſſiſtances his Majeſty had contributed to their part; what monies he had ſent to the Crown of <hi>Swede</hi> and the Hollanders; the ſtrong diverſions he had made in <hi>Italy,</hi> in <hi>Lorrain,</hi> and other places, the great Armies he maintained in his Frontiers to aſſiſt them if occaſion ſhould require, the great expences he had been at in ſundry Embaſſies, tending only to their advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage. Having thus recollected things paſt to their memories, he clearly repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto them the preſent State of affairs, how needfull it was that they ſhould preſerve their union, and take good Order for the ſubſiſtance of their Armies. This he did with ſuch vigour and Prudence both to them in general and particular, that he confirmed divers among them in the firſt deſigns of the League who were then wavering upon the King of <hi>Swede's</hi> death, and inclining to make a Peace with the Emperour. He was not ignorant that private intereſt is the moſt ſenſible part to touch a Prince on, and therefore clearly evinced unto them, that Peace being the only remedy which could cure the diſtempers of <hi>Germany,</hi> and that his Peace being neither advantagious nor honourable, if it did not reſtore liberty unto the Empire, and the ejected Princes to their Eſtates, there would be no means to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it but by their ſtrict union, which the Emperour not finding any means to break
<pb n="534" facs="tcp:56802:273"/>would in time deſpair of being able to ſupport him againſt their power, the far grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the two, whileſt their confederacy laſted. He had not much ado to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm them in beleeving the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> had long deſigned to render it ſelf Miſtris of all <hi>Germany,</hi> they having too many pregnant proofs to be ignorant of that truth, neither found he much difficulty to inſinuate unto them that their uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on failing would weaken their party, and give the Emperour a fair opportunity to ſeiz upon the Eſtates at his pleaſure. In fine, the found themſelves forc'd to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe they had no other way left but to be firm, and to ſtrengthen their confedera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy by a new Treaty. This advice conduced much to the end of his deſign, which having happily obtained, he loſt no more time, but entred upon the new Alliance, between the King and Kingdom of <hi>France</hi> on the one part, and <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Queen of <hi>Sweden</hi> and the Kingdom of <hi>Sweden,</hi> on the other part, which was concluded and ſigned by the Chancellour <hi>Oxenſtern.</hi> The firſt Article conteined the grounds of their Alliance, which was for the defence of their common friends, for the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing of the Ocean and Baltick Sea; for the obtaining a laſting Peace in the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, by which every one might be reſtored to his rights. The reſt imported that the Queen of <hi>Swede</hi> and her confederates ſhould entertain 30000 foot, and 6000 horſe, that the King ſhould contribute every year a million of Livers towards the charge of the War, that the confederates might raiſe Souldiers in one anothers Countries, that Delinquents and Fugitives ſhould be delivered to their Soveraign Lords to be by them puniſhed; that the Queen of <hi>Swede</hi> ſhould permit the free exerciſe of the Catholick Religion in all places which ſhe ſhould take, in the ſame manner as ſhe found it; that the Duxe of <hi>Baviers</hi> and the Princes of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick League might be admitted into the Treaty of Neutrality, if they pleaſed that all other States and Princes ſhould be invited to be of their confederacy; that there ſhould not be any Treaties but by and with the conſent of all the confederates, that their confederacy ſhould hold untill there were a Peace concluded, which if bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by the enemies, the confederates ſhould again take up Arms to aſſiſt one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The firſt Treaty was the foundation of the Union of the German Princes, who otherwiſe had ſoon accommodated themſelves with the Emperour, yet this was not all, it was neceſſary to conclude another with all the Princes and Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant States of high <hi>Germany;</hi> to obtain which, the <hi>Sieur de Feuquieres</hi> uſed his utmoſt diligence. The Articles agreed upon were, that there ſhould be a firm and ſtrict union between the Kingdom of <hi>Swede,</hi> and the Electors Princes and Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant States of high <hi>Germany;</hi> by vertue of which, they were to unite their Forces and to aſſiſt one another, untill <hi>Germany</hi> were ſetled in its firſt liberty; that the Laws of the Empire ſhould be in force, that the Princes ſhould be eſtabliſhed in their States and Poſſeſſions; that the Crown of <hi>Swede</hi> ſhould be ſatisfied for the expences of the War, and that a good and laſting Peace ſhould be ſetled. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, that the Chancellour <hi>Oxenſtern</hi> ſhould have the management of affairs, who to this end ſhould have a Counſel conſigned unto him, compoſed of qualified per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; ſome Officers of the Crown of <hi>Swede,</hi> and a Deputy of each Circuit of the Empire; that none of the Confederates in particular, ſhould treat of Peace with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the joynt conſent of the reſt; in which, if any one failed he ſhould be decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red an enemy; that the Confederates of the four Circuits ſhould furniſh the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies with Victuals, Ammunition, and Artillery; that the Armies ſhould take the Oath of Fidelity to the King of <hi>Swedes,</hi> and the Confederates; that the Preſident with the Counſel, ſhould take great care to retain the Souldier in good Order, and to ſecure Trade: In a word, that all the States and confederate Princes, ſhould oblige themſelves to maintain the Crown of <hi>Swede</hi> in the poſſeſſion of what they ſhould get in <hi>Germany,</hi> untill the War were ended, and that they were duly ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, as well as the confederates, for the loſſe which they had ſuſtained. This was the ſubſtance of the chief Articles of thoſe Treaties, which were looked upon to be ſo advantagious, that they were the ſubſtance of thoſe great Armies, which during this year check'd the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria's</hi> proceedings. Neither did the Cardinal receive any little glory by it, who by his continual Inſtructions and Orders, gave

The timorous muſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evitably meet with impediments in the execution of their deſigns; but they who are couragious, raiſe Trophies of glory to themſelves, ſo far are they from being diverted from their reſolutions by every wind.

I may adde, that this Element would be inconſiderable, without this ſecond quality, nor would a Prince be regarded by his neighbours, unleſſe he teſtifie a ſtrong reſolution of ſurmounting all difficulties. The wiſe Pilot forſaketh not the Helm at the ſight of every ſtorm, but keepeth on his courſe toward his Port, nor will a valorous Prince relinquiſh a great deſign up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on every obſtruction which thwarts him; but whetting his courage, and ſtirring up his valour he will bend all his indeavours to carry it to the end he firſt propoſed, well knowing, that all things do in the end give way to him who is conſtant and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute in affairs. Though <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi> were oftentimes inferiour to <hi>Pompey,</hi> as to number of Souldiers, yet was he never backward, during the whole War between them, to challenge him to the fight in confidence of the valour and experience of his Souldiers, long trained up in thoſe exerciſes. <hi>Fabius Maximus</hi> was no leſſe confident in the War which he managed againſt <hi>Hannibal;</hi> for ſeeing him appear like an impetuous torrent ſwoln up by freſh waters, whoſe courſe is hardly to be ſtopp'd at firſt by any obſtacle whatever; he quitted not the reſolution of over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comming him, but prudently judging that at the long run he might defeat him, without any hazard; he reſolved to accoſt him in all ſtraits and places of difficulty, where himſelf could not be aſſaulted but to the others great diſadvantage, and by this means he dull'd the edge of his Armies valour, newly puff'd up with their late victory, and was ſo happy that whiles he continued in that reſolution, <hi>Hannibal's</hi> Forces decayed. To ſuch generous examples ought a Prince to conform himſelf. Prudence may peradventure prompt a man to alter his courſe, intended for the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of his deſign, but the Laws of valour do not permit him to relinquiſh his firſt deſign, though he incounter ſome obſtacles in the execution; rather on the contrary, they oblige him to proſecute the end, otherwiſe he diſcrediteth himſelf, and letting his enemies take advantage of his weakneſs, offereth himſelf in the end a fit object for their victory.</p>

                  <head>The King ſendeth the Duke <hi>de Crequy</hi> to Pope <hi>Urbane</hi> the Eighth, to congratulate him according to cuſtome, and to compoſe the differences with the Venetians.</head>
                  <p>IT was not enough to provide for the affairs of <hi>Germany</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> unleſſe thoſe of <hi>Italy</hi> were likewiſe conſidered, unto which the Cardinal had diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed his Majeſty ſince the beginning of the year. Some perſon of quality was neceſſary to be ſent Extraordinary Embaſſadour to the Pope to render him obedience, nor indeed could his Majeſty longer defer that Complement. That this Embaſſie might ſerve for more then a bare ceremony, the Cardinal perſwaded his Majeſty to imploy ſome perſon capable to ſerve the Pope in the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween him and the Venetians, and to work his Holineſſe to favour the intereſts of <hi>France,</hi> as occaſion ſhould happen. To this end, he propoſed the Duke <hi>de Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quy,</hi> as a perſon whoſe great riches were not only able to bear the expence ſuitable to his honour; but withall, who had been a long time experienced in the affairs of <hi>Italy,</hi> and who had addreſs enough to diſpoſe the Pope to any thing, which would be reaſonably deſired. His Majeſty approved of this grand Miniſters choice, and concluded the Duke <hi>de Crecquy,</hi> to be a perſon very proper for that employment, nor was he ignorant that one of the greateſt points of policy, is to proportionate ment to buſineſs. His Majeſty according to the uſual Piety of the Kings, his Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors, gave him order to perform that obedience to the Pope, and making uſe of his uſual Prudence, commanded him to indeavour an accommodation between his Holineſs and the Venetians; and withall, to take occaſion from the troubles of <hi>Italy,</hi> to unite his Holineſs to the intereſt of <hi>France.</hi> The Duke <hi>de Crecquy</hi> accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted this Embaſſie with joy, having ever been of the humour to ſpend his mony up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his honour and pleaſure. The Magnificence wherewith it was proper he ſhould appear at <hi>Rome,</hi> obliged him to ſtay at Court till the beginning of <hi>May,</hi> the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to ſet forth his equipage; which ended, he went by water that he might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain his loſt time by the help of the Winds. Being come to <hi>Rome,</hi> he was receiv'd with all honours due to the Extraordinary Embaſſadour of the Chriſtian King, and eldeſt ſon of the Church; but the garb in which he appeared was ſuch, that ſince the ſtately Triumphs of the Emperours, nothing hath been ſeen like unto it. I will not trouble my ſelf to make a particular deſcription thereof, ſeeing other Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories relate it, intending only to obſerve that which paſſed of moſt conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the management of affairs. All I ſhall ſay, is, he had above five hundred perſons to attend him, Gold and Silver did ſo abound upon his Liveries, his Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, and among his whole equipage, as if he had been Maſter of the <hi>Indies.</hi> His firſt reception and audience was very ſtately; but that I may come to the effect of his Embaſſie, he firſt kiſſed his Holineſs's feet in his Majeſty's name, and paſs'd ſome Complements of Civility, next them the <hi>Sieur de B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>iſſieu,</hi> Lievtenant Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of <hi>Grenoble,</hi> who accompanied him in quality of his Majeſty's Orator, made the accuſtomed Oration of obedience, in which the moſt critical could diſcern no leſſe diſcretion then eloquence. He repreſented unto the Pope, that his Majeſty had not ſo long deferr'd to teſtifie his joy, for his promotion to the Papacy, but that he might likewiſe ſend with it, the Spoils his Arms had obtained upon the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of the Church, together with the proofs of his obedience. Next of all he obſerved to him the great benefits, protection, and aſſiſtance, which the Holy See had from time to received from the Kings of <hi>France;</hi> in conſideration where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, the had obtained the honour of Moſt Chriſtian and eldeſt Son of the Church. Thence he deſcended to a more particular deſcription of the ſignal advantages his Holineſſe had receiv'd from his Majeſties Victories, and aſſured his Holineſſe that the defence of his intereſt, would ever be the moſt acceptable imployment for his Forces; and in concluſion, that he might ſatisfie the chief end of his Embaſſie, he told him, that his Majeſty had no leſſe joy at his Holineſſe's promotion, then his
<pb n="537" facs="tcp:56802:274"/>Holineſs had heretofore had at his birth; that imitating the Piety of the Kings his Predeceſſors, he proſtrated himſelf at his feet, and moſt humbly kiſſed them with Proteſtations of honour and obedience due unto him, and that he acknowledged him for Chriſts only Vicar, the Succeſſor of <hi>St. Peter,</hi> and the Arbitrator of the Kingdom of Heaven in all things which concern Salvation, with caution however, that this ſubmiſſion was done out of Chriſtian civility, not duty, to prevent any miſtakes which might induced a belief that this Crown had ſome temporal depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance upon the Holy See. One of his Holineſſe's Secretaries, anſwered him with Complements and terms of honour, that his Holineſs did receive with great joy, thoſe teſtimonies of reſpect and obedience which his Majeſty rendred unto him; nor did the Pope himſelf omit any thing which might expreſſe his content; but the Duke, who chiefly deſigned to induce the Pope to befriend his Maſters inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts, as occaſion ſhould require, did no longer dwell upon Complements in his ſucceeding Audiences. He offered unto his Holineſſe the Arms of <hi>France</hi> to ſerve him on any occaſions, particularly his own indeavours to compoſe the difference he had with the Venetians; well knowing, that nothing doth more effectually ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige a Prince to the intereſt of another, then to let him ſee that he will meet with advantages by uniting himſelf with him. The difference between them, was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Confines of <hi>Gorre,</hi> and certain Iſlands of the Country beſides; ſome <hi>ran-contre</hi> there had been between the Romans and Venetians in <hi>Ferara,</hi> which was ſuſpected would be get an abſolute breach. The Pope whoſe power is never more conſpicuous then in Peace, was fearfull of it, ſo that he willingly accepted of his interpoſition, and that with much acknowledgement of his Majeſties affection for his intereſt; in proſecution whereof, the Duke parting from <hi>Rome,</hi> went to <hi>Venice</hi> to treat with ſuch as the Senate ſhould appoint concerning this affair. The <hi>Sieur de la Thuylerie,</hi> his Majeſty's Ambaſſadour Reſident with that Common-Wealth, ſo ordered affairs, that both parties did forbear their Arms, by which there was hopes of an accommodation. But before he departed from <hi>Rome,</hi> and after he had obliged his Holineſs by aſſuring him of his Majeſties readineſſe to aſſiſt him, by mediating in this affair; he was not defective in obtaining all poſſible advantages for the intereſt of <hi>France.</hi> He gave his Holineſſe a great inſight into the affairs of <hi>Germany,</hi> and diſcovered to him that their War was not for Religion, but meer State, the only diſpute being for the preſerving of the German Princes, in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of their eſtates, and thoſe indubitable rights which belong unto them, that his Majeſty was extreamly diſpleaſed to hear of ſome violences which were offered to certain Eccleſiaſtical perſons, though they were not ſo bad as were repreſented to him; which however was abſolutely contrary to the expreſs words of the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which is Majeſty had made, and by the fault of the Catholick Princes them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves who would not become Neuters; and that in fine, thoſe damages which the Church had received would eaſily be repaired by ſuch means as he repreſented unto his Holineſſe, with which he remained very well ſatisfied. He further con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed him in the knowledge which he had a long time had of the Houſe of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtria's</hi> deſigns upon <hi>Italy,</hi> which tend to the direct ruine of the Holy See; and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured his Holineſſe that his Majeſties Arms would protect him, and never forſake him. In fine, deſigning to ingage him in a defenſive League with <hi>France</hi> for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of the Eccleſiaſtical eſtate againſt the Venetians, or for ſecurity of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of <hi>Italy.</hi> His Holineſs who hath ever more feared then loved the Spaniards, could not be induced thereunto; alledging for his excuſe, that he reſolv'd to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine a common Father between the two Crowns. He was not backward to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent unto him, that a father doth not at all act againſt his relation, if he ſupport him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by one of his children, againſt the violence of another; but the Popes humour, which is naturally fearfull would afford nothing but aſſurances that his Holineſſe's forces ſhould not lie idle if any enterprize were made againſt the Churches great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or the liberties of <hi>Italy.</hi>

                  <p>THe Piety of our Kings and their zeal to the Pope, have made it a cuſtom to ſend Extraordinary Embaſſadours to congratulate them ſhortly after their promotions, to acknowledge them for Fathers truly ſpiritual, to aſſure them of their obedience in that quality, and to recommend unto them the French Church, their perſons and Kingdomes which God hath given them. There are ancient examples thereof, and withall, inſtructions yet extant given to Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours ſent by our Kings, which declare this obedience to tend only to congratula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Complement. The truth of this is evident, in the Letters which <hi>Philip le Bel,</hi> ſent to Pope <hi>Benedict</hi> the Eleventh, by the <hi>Sieur de Mercueil, Meſſieur Guillau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me du Pleſſis Cheval<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

The Court of Parliament made great Remonſtrances againſt it, both by word of mouth and writing; beſides the three States of the Kingdom aſſemb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led at <hi>Tours,</hi> complained to him of it, as may be ſeen in the papers preſented to him by <hi>Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

Some Italians I know there are who will needs have this Proteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of obedience to be an homage and a mark of temporal dependance; but the truth is, they only flatter the Pope upon no grounds: For to what end ſhould our Kings have, in temporal things, any dependance upon the Pope; ſeeing divers of them have acknowledged themſelves their Subjects, and confeſſed it in their wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings?

His Majeſty was not only pleaſed to ſend him a bare Commiſſion of <hi>Garde Seaux,</hi> as is commonly done, but expedited Letters Patents, to aſſure him of the Office of Chancellor of <hi>France,</hi> after <hi>Monſieur de Halygres</hi> death, well knowing, that men of his merit ought to be treated beſide the common Road, though ſuch was the modeſty of that great Miniſter, that he never aſcribed that favour to any thing but his Majeſties own goodneſſe.

Beſides, if he were honourably deſcended, his Majeſty was well informed that he was not ſatisfied with thoſe bare Titles wherewith his Fathers had adorned him; but that like the Cedars, who though they grow on the tops of Mountains, ceaſe not how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever to raiſe up their heads; his merit and induſtry had advanced him to the higheſt degree of virtuous men. He was in the common opinion of men, reputed for one of the trueſt maintainers of Juſtice; and indeed, he had diſcharged himſelf with ſuch courage and integrity, that neither the noiſe of greatneſſe, nor the ſight of riches, could ever ſo blind or affright him, as to ſurpize him. His Majeſty moſt certainly could not intruſt his Seals in any honeſter hand then his. The great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues he poſſeſſed, rendred him incapable of that corruption, which is annexed unto a neceſſitous fortune; yet this happy incapacity, conjoined with ſuch virtue made him ſo much the more proper for that office, in regard no one would dare to tempt him with money, who abounded both in riches and vertue. If his inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity made him immoveable in point of Juſtice, the ſolidity and penetrating viva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, of his ſpirit ſecured him from all poſſibility of a ſurpriſe, theſe two qualities permitting him to incline to no part but that of truth. Diſguiſements and Artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces could never form any Clouds, thick enough, to hide any thing from his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Oftentimes hath he been ſeen to diſguiſe darkneſſes and obſcurities in the diſcoveries of great offences. Withall the Sciences which he hath acquired in an high degree, had added no ſmal perfection to the natural endowments of his mind, for that his family were both learned and honeſt. When age had firſt given him the uſe of Reaſon, his kindred had taught him that Sciences give much luſtre to a man of Eminence; that they not only draw him from a ſtupid and ſavage life, but refine him, furbiſh him, and make him capable of all things, more ſweet, more civil,
<pb n="540" facs="tcp:56802:276"/>more courteous, more venerable, and more worthy of honour; and in fine, when he came to a riper age, whereas common ſpirits ſatisfie themſelves with learning ſome one Science conformable to their inclinations, he dived into the ſecrets of all, and became very accompliſhed in them, there being nothing ſo high which paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed his capacity. He had penetrated into the difficulteſt queſtions of Philoſophy and Divinity, the Law was his uſual employment, the Mathematicks his diverſions, with Hiſtory he was familiar, eloquence was natural to him; for before he had learned the rules of it, his diſcourſes were ſo repleniſhed with the ſtrength of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, with the purity of words, the ſweetneſſe and elegance of expreſſion, that his language was bewitching. Theſe things were not a little conſiderable in the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of a <hi>Garde de Seaux,</hi> who being his Majeſties mouth to expreſs his intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in all great Aſſemblies, is bound to ſpeak royally, that is, in terms becomming the Majeſty of his Maſter. I will not ſay any thing of his Piety, though that be ſo much the more conſiderable in a Stateſman, as it is the foundation of a Kingdomes happineſſe; becauſe it is a ſubject too large for me to ingage in; my diſcourſe of his merit being by accident, nor will I trouble my ſelf to give you a deſcription of the experience he had gotten in the Offices of a Councellour, a Maſter of Requeſts, Judge in divers Provinces, and Preſident <hi>au Mortier;</hi> his conduct and reputation have ſufficiently made it known: only this, theſe things concentring in him, ſeemed, as it were, to conſpire to force his Majeſty to chuſe him Miniſter of his Juſtice; I ſhall adde, that if his Soul was repleniſhed with all theſe qualities neceſſary in a great man; the King well ſaw the graces had indued his body, with all that could render him lovely, or acquire him reſpect and authority. He was alwaies gravely modeſt, his diſcourſe ſerious, his converſation agreeable and profitable, his pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in all affairs and all pleadings invincible, the complaiſance wherewith he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, was truly admirable, yet ſuch, that he could never be won to abate from Juſtice or his Majeſties ſervice. There need no more to love him, but only to ſee him, the charms of his words rendred that ſeverity which Juſtice obliged him ſometimes to uſe, ſo taking, that none could be offended at it. I would adde more, if the Laws of his Majeſties Hiſtory would permit me, though in ſome ſort it were not to deſiſt from his Majeſty's commendation, ſeeing there is not any thing which doth more apparently denote his Majeſties wiſedom, then the virtues and eminent qualities of his Miniſters, his nobleſt creatures.</p>

If Nobility without Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue

Among the reſt of thoſe virtuous qualities, or indeed in the Front of them, which ought to ſet off a perſon of quality, this I account the chiefeſt, that he be indued with an high natural ability, and that clearneſſe of judgement which diſſipateth the Clouds of falſities, diſcovereth truth, and going before Juſtice, uſhereth it in as ſome Stars do the Sun. Learning ought to go hand in hand with this ability, ſeeing natural parts without improvement are ſo much the more dangerous, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard they are ſubject to failings, and like the fruitfulneſſe of a field, which if not cultivated, ſerves only to produce the more Thorns. Amongſt the Sciences, thoſe of Juſtice and Policy are moſt needfull, for that they are the true Objects of Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellours and Lord Keepers; thoſe are the Fountains, from whence they man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive the maximes of Government, the Fundamental Laws of Monarchy, the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes and Cuſtomes, and generally whatever concerns the duty of Magiſtrates, the Office of Judges, and art of Lawyers. To this Doctrine, I may adde Experience, a thing ſo neceſſary in a Lord-Keeper and Chancellor, that without it, the very grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt lights wherewith their natural parts or ſtudy can furniſh them, are as little uſefull, as the inſtrument in the hand of a workman, skill'd in the Theory, but not the Practick. Integrity ought to accompany him, being the Mother of Loyalty, and the Father of that zeal which all publick perſons are obliged to evidence in the Adminiſtration of their Charges. The Integrity of a perſon of ſmall ability, will indeed ſo far carry him, that the publick good will be the end at which he aims, but he cannot contribute ſo much unto it, as willingly he would, whereas he who is deſtitute thereof, doth moſt frequently look after his own intereſt. It was not the want of capacity but fidelity, which ſo often expoſed the Athenians and thoſe other Common-Wealths of <hi>Greece,</hi> to the fury of Forraign and Civil Wars. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was that illuſtrious corner of the World ſo repleniſhed with Phyloſophers, Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors and great Stateſmen, as when it firſt began to decay; but that unbridled Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion which leadeth great men to prefer their own intereſts before that of the States which they govern, hurrieth them into that misfortune which betides the body of man; where the Stomach which ought to concoct nutriment for the indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual parts, digeſteth it onely for it ſelf. Eloquence will be of no ſmall uſe to them in many occaſions, where they are obliged to pronounce judgements, and declare their Maſters Wills; it elevateth a man ſo much above others, ſaith the Roman Orator, as ſpeech raiſeth him above his fellow creatures. If it be befit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and uſefull to any, it is particularly to Stateſmen; for there is not any thing which acquires more authority to a man appearing in publick, then good elocution. For my part, I think Eloquence ſo much the more proper for them, in regard it perſwades the people to approve what Wiſedom directeth, what Prudence reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth, and what Juſtice requireth; without it, the wiſeſt Counſels have oftentimes been ineffectual. I will not diſ-approve the advancing of rich perſons to ſuch dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities; becauſe riches if lawfully acquired, do give much credit to vertue, ſerve to excite it, and execute their juſt and generous deſigns. I think them very ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for a man who is to ſerve the publick, experience teaching us, that without them, vertue is often weak and languiſhing. Though vertue alone merit before God, it is unactive, unfruitfull, and inglorious among men. To be ſhort, where the Goods of the body, co-habit with thoſe of the mind and fortune, in eminent perſons; it adds no ſmall authority unto them, ſeeing the beauty and Majeſty of the body hath certain attractions to captivate the courage, to inforce reſpect and reverence, and to perſwade men to what ever they pleaſe; infomuch that the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients have thought them worthy of Crowns and Empires.</p>

                  <p>THe Church ought neceſſarily to be governed by Biſhops, whoſe Doctrine and Piety may ſerve for a guide to the people to inſtruct them in the ways of Heaven. The State receiveth no ſmall advantage by them. Hereupon, the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal did very wel reſolve to perſwade his Majeſty not to beſtow any Biſhoprick, but upon perſons well-deſerving, who might be capable of ſerving God and the State, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially not to grant them unto children or perſons of a licentious life, or ſuch as lay under any ignominy as had formerly been practiced; ſo that in a few yeas the face of the Clergy of <hi>France</hi> was much altered, being repleniſhed with perſons of abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and virtue. This was put in execution in all vacant places, after the Cardinal's promotion to the Miniſtery. I ſhall forbear to ſpeak of it, till the Hiſtory of this year, becauſe it furniſheth us with many examples.

                  <p>AMong the Rights of this Crown, that of the preſenting to Biſhopricks, is one of the moſt ſignal, as moſt ancient. The Primitive Biſhops of the French Church, who have been the moſt ſhining lights of our Faith, have acknowledged it from the beginning of this Monarchy, in the fifth Councel of <hi>Orleans,</hi> where they ordained that none ſhould conſecrate any Biſhop, without his Majeſty's conſent, the practice whereof is ſo frequent in Hiſtory, that nothing but ignorance can queſtion it. <hi>Gregory</hi> of <hi>Tours</hi> reporteth, that Biſhop <hi>Quintianus</hi> being dead, <hi>Gallus</hi> was ſubſtituted in his place, and created Biſhop of <hi>Overgne,</hi> by his Majeſty's means; and that after <hi>Gallus</hi> his deceaſe, there was ſome deſign to elect one <hi>Cato,</hi> but that the Arch-Deacon <hi>Cantinus</hi> having prevented the King, and firſt acquainted him with the news of <hi>Gallus</hi> his death, was conſtituted Biſhop in his place.

Biſhops have a great influence over the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples ſprits, to draw them by the links of Piety and Religion, unto what they pleaſe, as experience hath evidenced, in the time of <hi>Lewis</hi> the <hi>Debonnair,</hi> who was almoſt Depoſed by a Faction they raiſe againſt him, and as was afterward ſeen in <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guedoc,</hi>

The happineſſe of States dependeth much upon Religion, and the ſplendour of Religion, doth more depend upon the vigilance and care of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, next to the bleſſing of Heaven, the any other thing whatever. May they not indeed be called the foundation of it? Who doth more effectually fix the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in the fidelity which they ow their Soveraigns, in obedience to Magiſtrates, in reverence to Parents, in reſpect to Juſtice, the rule of their conduct? Doubtleſſe it is then very conſiderable in Government, not to chuſe ſuch perſons as are inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of bringing theſe advantages to a State. I ſhall not in this place ſay any thing of the obedience they ought to ſhew to Magiſtrates; but only it is neceſſary that they be honeſt men; becauſe if licentious they will be apt to do more hurt then good, and to neglect the reſtraining of the people, not that I ſhall approve of chuſing ſuch perſons who are of an indiſcreet zeal; for ſuch perſons deſigning to do too much good, do oftentimes raiſe great diſorders, which themſelves are unable to redreſſe. Preachers are ſo much the more deſerving of this promotion, becauſe the function of preaching, was primitively reſerved to the Biſhops, who communicated it unto Prieſts, only by way of priviledge, and that at ſundry times in ſundry places. The Biſhops of the Eaſt, did firſt grant this power to Prieſts, as may be proved by the examples of <hi>Pierius</hi> and <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> who while they were yet Prieſts, Preached one in <hi>Alexandria,</hi> the other in <hi>Antioch,</hi> a thing not uſed in <hi>Affrick</hi> before <hi>St. Auſtine,</hi> who during his Prieſthood, had the liberty of Preaching conferred upon him, by Biſhop <hi>Valerius,</hi> a thing without Preſident; and in <hi>Gaul</hi> this cuſtom was introduced, about an hundred year after the Councel of <hi>Vaiſon.</hi>

                  <p>VVHen Kings create Magiſtrates, and communicate part of their power to them; it is not to exempt them from obedience, but to fix their Crowns by new ſupports, and to keep the people by their examples and decrees within the bounds of their ſubjection. To this end only it is, that Kings confer their power upon them, who as they command their people to make their addreſſes to them, to decide their differences; ſo do they no leſſe oblige their Magiſtrates to preſerve them within their bounds, by the example of their ſubmiſſions, and the integrity of their judgements. If Magiſtrates ow the ſecond to the people by their places, they are no leſſe indebted to their Kings, in the firſt, with this diſtinction of obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, that the good of the State invites them to it, the Order of Monarchy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth it, and Juſtice it ſelf commandeth it.

What a diſorder were it, if the inferiour Spheres, ſhould oppoſe the moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the <hi>Primum mobile?</hi> And what likelyhood is there, that thoſe Magiſtrates who receive their Authority from their Princes to ſupport their Crowns, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm their Subjects in their obedience, ſhould flie into Rebellion, and indeavour to draw them to follow their examples? They ought to beware that their diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience do not cauſe the <hi>Flower de luces</hi> to fade, and that they do not inſtead of cultivating them with care, to render them more beautifull to the French, and more reſpected by ſtrangers, indanger them by their ill examples, and render themſelves unworthy to ſit upon them.

In affairs of this nature, Kings are obliged to conform themſelves to the example of the Sun, who finding the Moon to oppoſe her light to his, and indeavouring to eclipſe his light preſently depriveth her of all her light, and turneth her Chriſtaline into a dark bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy King ought to re-aſſume to themſelves their Juſtice, which formerly they

                  <p>IT is very important, when there is any ſuſpicion of civil diſſentions, to intruſt the Government of Provinces and places with perſons of fidelity. I do much approve of the King of <hi>Spain's</hi> rule, who often changeth his Governours. A man muſt be altogether ignorant of Hiſtory, if he knoweth not the great ſervices which <hi>Gonzalvus</hi> did the King of <hi>Aragon</hi> his Maſter, in the Kingdom of <hi>Naples:</hi> How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, that wiſe prudent King, would not alwaies intruſt the Government of that place with him; for fear, leſt in proceſſe of time, he might keep it to himſelf. The continuation of the Government of <hi>France</hi> granted unto <hi>Julius Caeſar,</hi> incouraged him to attempt upon the Roman liberty; whereupon, remembring that nothing had made him ſo ambitious of commanding, as that continuation upon his return to <hi>Rome,</hi> after the <hi>Affrick</hi> War, he ordained that to <hi>Praetor</hi> ſhould injoy his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, above one year, nor no Conſul above two. The Governour who hath long reſided in a Province, may make creatures, contract frienſhips; an ſo play his game, that he may act the little King, and will be apt to ingage himſelf to ſome Revolt, if Ambition, which great men ſeldom want, ſhould once inflame him. This made the Dictator <hi>Mamercus,</hi> ſay, the ſhort continuation of Governours is the ſureſt preſervative of the publick; beſides, the liberty of changing of Gove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours,
<pb n="546" facs="tcp:56802:279"/>after ſome few years, and ſubſtituting others in their places, is of great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, for that a Soveraign may thereby render more perſons capable of great affairs, then if he ſhould alwaies continue them in the ſame places. The memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of new benefits diſpoſeth men to be gratefull, and doubtleſſe maketh Kings to be ſerved with more affection: Great men long accuſtomed do ſo habituate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that they look upon their Governments as their Demeſne, without any ſenſe of obligation to him who permitteth him; whereas he who is but lately poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed of them, having the favour freſh in his memory, indeavoureth to deſerve it with more induſtry and affection. This <hi>maxime,</hi> I know wil not very much agree with the ſenſe of moſt great men; but ſurely their diſlike reliſheth more of Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion then reaſon; I may likewiſe adde, that it is little conſiderable to their For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, ſeeing if they acquit themſelves, as they ought, of a place, their merit will be a ſufficient recommendation to attain them others. It were to be wiſhed, that ſuch men in their own concerns, were of <hi>Quintus Fabius Maximus</hi> his humour, who having been five times Conſul; and conſidering with himſelf that his grand-father and great grand-father had often been charged with the ſame Office; and how it was very dangerous to continue great Offices in a family, was very earneſt with the people of <hi>Rome,</hi> to divert them from conferring that honour on his ſon.</p>

It is impoſſible in ſuch affairs to content all men, becauſe there are never ſo many places vacant, as men who think their ſervices worthy of that honour. All that can be done, is to prefer thoſe who are moſt conſiderable, either for their birth, their ſervices, or the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular inclination of the Prince, who in ſuch things ought to have his own liberty. His Majeſty took this courſe, but that he might totally follow the Orders of the Primitive conſtitution<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he gave a Commiſſion to the Cardinal <hi>de Lyon,</hi> great Alm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of <hi>France,</hi> and Commander of the Order, to inform him of their Religion, Life, and Works, who were propoſed, and to ſend him his informations ſeal'd up. The next thing his Majeſty did, was to aſſemble the Chapter of the Order at <hi>Fountainbleau,</hi> where the Ceremony was performed, and where all the Knights met, and told them by the mouth of the <hi>Sieur de Bullion,</hi> Lord Keeper of that Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that he ſhould be very glad before the Creation of the Knights, to have their opinions about the Rebellion and Felony of the Duke <hi>d' Elboeuf,</hi> and the Marqueſs <hi>de la Vieville,</hi> who being fled out of the Kingdom, and having born Arms contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to his Majeſties ſervice; and conſequently broken the Statutes of the Order, had rendred themſelves unworthy of Knight-hood, and deſerved to be degraded; the <hi>Sieur de Bullion,</hi> adding that his advice was, to follow the example of <hi>Charles</hi> Duke <hi>de Bourgogne,</hi> towards <hi>Charles</hi> Duke <hi>de Brabant</hi> his couſin, <hi>viz.</hi> to eraſe their Arms, and that in their Eſcutcheon ſhould be inſerted their judgement and degradation. All the Knights were of the ſame opinion with the Lord Keeper, excepting only the Marqueſſe <hi>de Trajanel:</hi> So that the judgement of their degra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation was pronounced and executed before the new Creation. In proſecution of this judgement, his Majeſty cauſed the Role of thoſe whom he would have of this Order to be read aloud, and nominated eight Knights to aſſiſt at the tryal of the
<pb n="547" facs="tcp:56802:279"/>proofs of their Nobility, Life, and Manners; and the propoſing the difference which was between thoſe who were Dukes and Peers, and thoſe who were only Dukes, concerning their order and place in the Ceremony; it was ordered that all the Dukes in general ſhould march according to the Order of their Creation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Peers hold no place in Aſſemblies. It was likewiſe decreed, that if any of thoſe who were name to be Knights, did not appear at the time of the promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to receive their Order, it ſhould not be ſent unto them. The 14 of <hi>May</hi> was the day aſſigned for the Ceremony, and his Majeſty being there punctually follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Statutes of that Order, and conferred it upon

                  <head>Politique Obſervation.</head>
                  <p>THe reward of Services, and the puniſhment of Crimes, are equally great ſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to a State; whereupon <hi>Socrates</hi> being demanded, what Eſtate could be eſteemed the beſt governed, anſwered, that where honeſt men are rewarded, and knaves puniſhed. <hi>Xenophon</hi> likewiſe thought, that a man being naturally more couragious the fearfull, ſhould be excited ſooner to great actions by praiſe riches or honours after a Victory? For this reaſon it was, that <hi>Plato</hi> in the Fifth of his Republicks, would that all men who behaved themſelves couragiouſly in the War, ſhould be gratified in all reaſonable things, nay they were permitted to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry divers women, the better to repleniſh the Common-Wealth with valiant men.</p>
                  <p>This licentiouſneſſe, I muſt confeſſe, is contrary to the Laws of Chriſtianity, and Experience hath told us, that it is ſeldom ſeen, brave men beget children like them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; but in the main, the gratifying of valiant men in all reaſonable things, is
<pb n="548" facs="tcp:56802:280"/>conformable to the rules of all politick States. Thus <hi>Homer</hi> to give a teſtimony of <hi>Agamemnon's</hi> conduct, doth uſually bring him in at all feaſts in the Greek Army, honoured with an whole Chine of Beef, being the greateſt rarity among them. Upon the ſame example, <hi>Plato</hi> grounded his Decrees for the honouring of thoſe at publick Feaſts, who had given proofs of their valour by ſerving them with the greateſt dainties, and the beſt Wines; and by ſinging of ſongs in their praiſe, to invite others to imitate them. To ſpeak the truth, if the flame dies for want of Wood, generoſity languiſheth if unrewarded. All goeth to rack in that State where men of courage are no better treated then uſeleſſe cowards. It ſhould ſeem the greateſt courages are, as it were, benum'd, where the ſplendour of honour, the reward of handſom actions, doth not incourage them. All that can be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther obſerved is, that recompences be proportioned to the qualities of the perſons. Souldiers are more uſually pleas'd with riches then honour, and are more proper to be acknowledged with reward accordingly. The Nobility on the other ſide, are better ſatisfied with honour, <hi>Let them have it.</hi> This courſe did the Common-Wealth of <hi>Venice</hi> take, after that memorable battle of <hi>Tar;</hi> they exalted the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis of <hi>Mantua,</hi> from that government, to be general of the Army; and as to thoſe Souldiers who had behav'd themſelves couragiouſly, they increas'd their pay. They gave divers recompences to the Sons of ſuch as were ſlain, Dowries to their daughters, and good Penſions to ſuch as were maim'd. The Romans did much more eſteem the rewards of honour, then any other; and indeed they are more to be eſteemed, becauſe Honour is more excellent then Wealth. There was no Crown more eſteemed among them, then the obſidional, which however was made of Turf, that of Gold inlaid with Stones, was beneath it, becauſe leſſe ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable; there was not any greater honour in their Common-Wealth then that of Triumph, which however brought no Wealth to the Triumpher; for after he had appeared in a Chariot cloathed and attended magnificently, he was obliged to live in the City, in the quality of a private perſon, without other reward then the glory of their actions. <hi>Cneus Ovillius,</hi> thought himſelf more highly rewarded, after he had concluded the firſt Carthaginian War, by the Common-Wealths per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting him to have a Trumpet alwaies march before him; and <hi>Pompey</hi> by the power granted him wear his Triumphant Robe at all publick Feaſts and <hi>Caeſar</hi> by the priviledge of continually wearing the Lawrel Crown, then if they had had all the riches of the Empire divided amongſt them.</p>

                  <p>AFter the King had reduc'd to his Obedience divers Cities and places of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhopricks of <hi>Mets, Toul, and Verdun.</hi> and recovered to his Crown divers Lands and Lordſhips, heretofore pulled from it; he thought it neceſſary for the preſervation of the people in Obedience and Peace, and for conſervation of the Rights of his Crown to eſtabliſh a Soveraign court of Juſtice, which ſhould have full power to Judge, without further Appeal, all matters both civil and criminal. His Majeſty was the rather invited unto it, by the earneſt intreaties of all the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the Cities and Provinces, in proſecution of the promiſe made unto them, by the late King <hi>Henry le grand;</hi> eſpecially to redreſſe thoſe great abuſes committed in the Adminiſtration of Juſtice, in regard of the inexperience of the Magiſtrates, as to prevent the Dukes of <hi>Lorrain's</hi> uſurpation, who had oftentimes preſumed to give judgement in places; and upon perſons depending on the Crown of <hi>France.</hi> It was reſolved about the beginning of the year. The King ordained a Soveraign court, with the Title of Parliament, in his Biſhopricks of <hi>Toul, Mets,</hi> and <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dun;</hi> the ſeat whereof he founded at <hi>Mets;</hi> both in regard of the commodiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the ſcituation; as alſo the populouſneſs of the place, and confluence of the people, which came from all parts; and beſides, that place having been formerly
<pb n="549" facs="tcp:56802:280"/>the Metropolis of <hi>Auſtracia,</hi> one of the beſt Flowers of this Crown. His Majeſty ordained there ſhould be one chief Preſident, ſix other Preſidents, forty ſix Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors, of which ſix ſhould be of the Clergy, the reſt of the Laity, one Attorney General, two Advocates General; and to brief, all Officers uſual in other Parliaments, to execute Juſtice, without Appeal, every ſix moneths, upon the Cities and perſons of thoſe Biſhopricks; as alſo upon <hi>Mouzon, Chaſteau-Regnaud,</hi> and its Appurte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances; notwithſtanding any Soveraignty they might heretofore claim: Laſtly, deſiring to chuſe ſuch perſons as might be capable of doing actual ſervice in this Parliament, he committed the charge of chief Preſident to the <hi>Sieur de Bretaign,</hi> and of the other Preſidents to the <hi>Sieurs</hi> of <hi>Charpentier, Blundeau, Pinon, Treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon, Vignier</hi> and <hi>Chanteclair,</hi> all men of worth; that of Attorney General to the <hi>Sieur de Paris,</hi> Maſter of Requeſts; thoſe of the two Advocates General, to the <hi>Sieurs de la Greſliere, Remifort,</hi> and <hi>Fardoil;</hi> they had all Commiſſion to go with four Maſters of Requeſt, and five or ſix who were created Counſellours, to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh the Parliament, which they did about the end of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> to the great happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and ſatisfaction of the inhabitants of <hi>Mets,</hi> glad to ſee their City re-aſſume its ancient ſplendour; and true it is, the induſtry they uſed to preſerve his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties right, and the people in their obedience, did not a little conduce to the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment of the Royal Authority in its luſtre.</p>

                  <p>AS Subjects ow love and obedience to their Kings; ſo Kings ow them Juſtice and affection. The debts are mutual, and two incumbent duties, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the moſt agreeable harmony in States, upon the accompliſhment of which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendeth the good fortune of both Prince and People; which being ſo, a Prince can no ſooner conquer a country, but be is obliged to do them Juſtice; nor is it of ſmall importance to him to execute it by new Judges, and to change the old Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates. <hi>Caeſar</hi> and <hi>Nero</hi> knew it well enough, by their indeavours to ſuppreſſe the Senate, at leaſt to diminiſh their power when they deſpaired of being able abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely to depoſe them. In a word, the Soveraign power being compoſed of the Authority of a Prince, and that of Magiſtrates, to force a country out of the hands of another Prince, and not to change the Magiſtrates, were to be but half Maſter of it; for their Prince having beſtowed thoſe imployments on them, they cannot but preſerve ſome affection for him, nor wil they ever fail to ſerve him, ſo that great inconveniences may thereby ariſe; for as they in ſome ſort ſerve as a Chain to tie the people in obedience to their Soveraign, they will do their utmoſt indeavour to preſerve them in their dependance upon him, from whom they have received their imployments, and with time they are able to cauſe a general inſurrection. A Seat of Juſtice though without a Sword, with the Purple onely, and thoſe other marks of its dignity, doth oftentimes cauſe that which they favour, to be more reſpected and obeyed, then the force of an whole Army, ſo much are the people us'd to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to its judgements, and to follow its motions; therefore there is nothing of a conqueſt ſecured, untill the Conquerour hath ſetled ſuch Magiſtrates as are affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate and loyal to his ſervice.

The <hi>Sieur de Mommas</hi> ſecured them all three, which being ſignified to the chief Preſident, they were examined, and Proceſſe made againſt <hi>Alpheſton</hi> in the uſual form; it was proved, that <hi>Alpheſton</hi> having murthered a certain Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rier, called <hi>Clairbourg,</hi> for fear leſt he ſhould diſcover a deſign upon <hi>St. Diſier,</hi> which he had intruſted with him, fled into <hi>Flanders,</hi> where having made ſome ſtay at <hi>Bruxels,</hi> he got acquainted with Father <hi>Chanteloup,</hi> and one <hi>la Roche,</hi> intendent of his affairs, who had ingaged him, together with <hi>Sauſier</hi> and <hi>Bellanger,</hi> to kill the Cardinal <hi>Duc de Richelieu,</hi> paſſing through <hi>Chaallons,</hi> where they were to lodge over againſt him; that they had been aſſured by Father <hi>Chanteloup,</hi> how that affair had been conſulted by perſons of Piety and Learning, and adjudged it might be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted with a ſafe Conſcience; that <hi>la Roche</hi> had given an hundred Livres to <hi>Sau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſier,</hi> as many to <hi>Bellanger,</hi> and a hundred crowns to <hi>Alpheſton,</hi> with promiſe to reward their ſervices better; that <hi>Alpheſton</hi> had oftentimes converſed with Father <hi>Chanteloup</hi> concerning that affair; that <hi>la Roche</hi> had cauſed a Gelding of the Queens Stable to be given him, which was afterwards known to be the ſame, by the <hi>Sieur de Villiers,</hi> one of her <hi>Querris.</hi> All this was Depoſed by <hi>Sauſier</hi> and <hi>Bellanger,</hi> and confeſſed by <hi>Alpheſton</hi> himſelf; ſo that he was condemned upon the 23 of <hi>September,</hi> to be broke on the wheel for his offence. The Sentence was executed, and as it is very important for the ſecurity of Kings and their States, to pardon thoſe who diſcover things of this nature; <hi>Sauſier</hi> and <hi>Bellanger</hi> were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted in conformity to the Law preſcribed in ſuch caſes.

Thus did they indeavour to infuſe the poiſon of this abhominable Doctrine, into the minds of ſome melancholy men, and to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade them to Dye their hands in the blood of a Cardinal, a Biſhop, a chief and incomparable Miniſter of State.

                  <p>TO murther a Cardinal is a deteſtable ſacriledge, not onely becauſe it injureth a particular perſon, but the ſacred Colledge of Cardinals, the Pope, and the whole Church. He who murdereth a Miniſter of State, is guilty of high Treaſon, as I have heretofore made appear, and generally of all others, it is the moſt hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible Crime. Murderers among the Iſraelites were ſo much deteſted, that pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate men were allowed to deſtroy them, if the Magiſtrate did not; nay, he who had killed another by accident was in ſuch abhomination with them, that he was ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed his Country as unworthy of their converſation and forced to retire to their Cities of refuge, under penalty of being ſlain, without puniſhment by him who had undertaken to revenge the death. All nations have chaſtiſed it with grievous pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments; thoſe of <hi>Braſil</hi> in particular do ſo deteſt it, that if the murderer ſave himſelf by flight, yet his children, ſiſters and couſins are all made ſlaves to the kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred of the party murthered. Hath not God declared himſelf an enemy unto it, when he ſaith, He who killeth his Brother ſhall dy by the ſword. Hiſtory is full of examples verifying his Divine juſtice to correſpond with his threats. <hi>Plutarch</hi> though having the light of nature onely, writeth that a certain murderer of one <hi>Mitias</hi> a <hi>Grecian</hi> eſcaping ſcot free, the divine providence ſo ordered it, that his ſtatue fell upon him in the publick place, and cruſhed him to death; but if mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der deſtroy thoſe that are guilty thereof with ſhame, ſurely all Princes peccant in this particular are much more blame-worthy; becauſe they do an act contrary to that mercy, juſtice, generoſity, and greatneſſe of power which they are obliged to have. Never would the Romans in the flouriſhing time of their Common-Wealth, permit their enemies to be thus kill'd; and <hi>Tacitus</hi> reporteth, that when the Senate read <hi>Algau deſtrius</hi> Prince of the <hi>Catti</hi> his Letters, in which he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took to poiſon <hi>Arminius</hi> the German Captain, provided they would ſend him poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, return'd him this anſwer, that the people of <hi>Rome</hi> uſed to have ſatisfaction from their enemies, openly and not by treachery.

Hereupon it was not long before they vaniſhed, excepting the Regiments <hi>de Guerquoy,</hi> to the Commander of which he had forgot to make known his intention. Nor did he forbear to teſtifie that this very Regiment, abiding ſome while in his Majeſties ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice was diſpleaſing to him; for upon the return into his Territories, after the Marſhal <hi>de Effiats</hi> deceaſe, he disbanded them, that he might beſtow them upon <hi>Vervane</hi> a Subject of his, and Souldier of Fortune, who led them into <hi>Alſace,</hi> where he got into <hi>Maſſenal,</hi> and was defeated by the <hi>Swede.</hi> He was oblig'd to hinder any Levies in his country, made without his Majeſties conſent; but he gave way thereunto, at the ſame time that <hi>Ajax</hi> the Italian indeavoured to get into <hi>Briſac.</hi> The Treaty ingaged him not do any thing againſt the Allies of <hi>France;</hi> and he paſt his word to General <hi>Horn,</hi> not to countenance any deſign againſt <hi>Haguenaw,</hi> which place he under-hand aſſiſted with fifteen hundred men; and without regard had to his word, gave forces to the <hi>Cemte de Salme,</hi> under pretence of diſcharging them, which afforded him the means and opportunity of taking in that place; nor did he afterward contribute to preſerve the place, by ſending Victuals and Souldiers to fortifie that Gariſon. Every one knows he gave leave to <hi>Montecuculi Benti vog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lio &amp; Naſſau,</hi> to raiſe Forces in <hi>Lorrain,</hi> for three or four moneths time; the two former pretending all that while they would deſert the ſervice; but did indeed ſend them to fight againſt the <hi>Swede;</hi> and the laſt of them, did openly lead his forces into <hi>Alſace.</hi> Moreover, as weak courages do eaſily paſſe from anger to cruelty, the paſſion he had againſt <hi>France,</hi> and its Allies, tranſported him to many unworthy actions: For more cruel deeds, then thoſe of <hi>Naſſau,</hi> could not be conceived by the wit of Man, who ſometimes was with his Forces at <hi>Sarguemine,</hi> robbing and killing all ſuch French Merchants as he could meet with; he cauſed a murther to be executed upon Collonel <hi>du Bois,</hi> who had very worthily ſerved the <hi>Swedes</hi> in <hi>Germany;</hi> he committed violences in the Territory of <hi>Strasbourg,</hi> in the Dutchy of <hi>Deux Ponts,</hi> and the <hi>Comte de Hanau;</hi> he highly injured the <hi>Comte d' Halberſtein,</hi> taking him in his ſhirt out of his bed, and plundering his houſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any other difference, but only becauſe he had alwaies been affectionate to <hi>France;</hi> he kept barbarous cut throats, at Saint <hi>Hypolitus,</hi> to rob and kill all ſuch Swedes and French, as paſſed by, but weakly attended. That he might the more abſolutely declare himſelf for the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> againſt the Allies of <hi>France;</hi> did he not proclaim, in his Army, by ſound of Trumpet, that no one ſhould pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to call it any other then the Emperours Army? And did he not cauſe it to march under that notion, unto the Fort of <hi>Gerbaden,</hi> to beat off the Swedes who had beſieged it? Did he not frequently entertain diſcourſes and correſpondencies with the chief of his Officers, with the <hi>Comte de Salm, Montecuculi, Merode,</hi> and the Marquis <hi>de Celade?</hi> Did he not receive the monies brought by the laſt of them, to pay his forces, with the ſame ſatisfaction and facility, as the Souldiers ſent by the <hi>Valsfeign,</hi> and the confiſcation ſent him by the Emperour, of all his Neighbour Princes, and Allies of <hi>France</hi>'s lands, who were in the Aſſembly of <hi>Hailbron?</hi> Did he not likewiſe make a League with the Emperour; whereby <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guenau,</hi> and the other ten Cities of the Imperial Provoſt, together with <hi>Scleſtat</hi> and <hi>Colmah,</hi> were delivered to him for their moſt ſtrict intelligence, though at that very time he was obliged by Treaty with the King, not to ingage himſelf with any Prince, without his Majeſties knowledge or conſent? Nor ſatisfied with that alone, he cauſed the Marquis <hi>de Ville,</hi> to tell the Swedes contrary to all likelyhood and truth, that he might make them jealous of the King, how he acted nothing againſt them, but by his Order, and ſent ten thouſand men to force them from the ſiege of <hi>Haguenau.</hi> Indeed he was the Author of his own puniſhment; for they fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding themſelves forc'd to leave their Trenches, march'd out, cut off a party of them, and took his Canon and Baggage. This Procedure did ſufficiently diſcover his Paſſion, but he ſtayed not there, rather as if he had delighted to break all Articles
<pb n="553" facs="tcp:56802:282"/>of former Treaties, he would not be perſwaded to do his homage for <hi>Bar</hi> and though after infinite delays, he did at laſt ſend Commiſſaries to eſtimate the Demeſnes of <hi>Clermont;</hi> the Propoſitions they made in valuing the buildings and fortifications contrary to the Treaty, which imported that he ſhould pay after the rate of fifty years purchaſe in hand; for the Revenue only, did ſufficiently teſtifie that they came not to perform the Treaty, but under that pretext to break it. Nor was he more exact in obſerving that Article, wherein he was obliged not to give any har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour or paſſage to his Majeſties Subject, who ſhould be out of <hi>France,</hi> contrary to his Majeſties pleaſure, nor to entertain any correſpondence with them, ſeeing he continually treated with thoſe who abuſed <hi>Monſieur</hi> the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> his cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulity and favour. In general it may be ſaid, that hatred and choller had gotten ſo tranſcendent a poſſeſſion over his Soul, that they forced him to recede from all kind of honour, nay, and to neglect his own intereſt, and all to revenge himſelf againſt <hi>France,</hi> which he hop'd to effect by the Spaniards means, who when he had concluded the Treaty with the Hollander, then in agitation and probability, had ingag'd to aſſiſt <hi>Monſieur</hi> with all his Forces, to invade the Kingdom, to force his Majeſty to ſuch conditions of Peace, as himſelf pleaſed, to compel him to rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie <hi>Monſieurs</hi> marriage with the Princeſſe <hi>Marguerite;</hi> and finally to ſurrender to him ſuch places as he had made himſelf Maſter of.</p>

                  <p>IF Choler be blamable in private perſons, it is no leſſe dangerous for Soveraigns, then pernicious for their Eſtates; Prudence ought to be the guide of all their actions, without which they will be inevitably reduc'd to troubleſom inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. Who knoweth not that Choler is incompatible with this vertue, and an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to all good counſels? A Prince may ſometimes make Choler as uſefull to him as Souldiers, and may be thereby drawn to a generous impetuoſity to ſurmount al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt incredible difficulties; but there is a difference betwixt that gentle heat which increaſes courage, and that fire which inflames and ſubdues our reaſon; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a Prince muſt be carefull that he let not his paſſion pervert his judgement, to precipitate his reaſon into baſe reſolutions. He who among Kings hath deſerved the name of wiſe, ſaith, It is better to moderate choler, then to take a City. Now although this Paſſion ſeemeth to carry the ſtamp of courage, becauſe it pretendeth to vanquiſh all, and to ſubſcribe to no man, yet really it is a weakneſſe, which whoever ſurmounteth, is incomparably a perſon of more ſpirit and courage, then he who ſuffereth himſelf to be tranſported by it.

A Phyloſopher was demanded why he would not meddle with publick affairs. Not, quoth he, that I fear them, but ſuſpect my ſelf; intimating, that his naturally cholerick humour was totally repugnant to the management of State-affairs. Amongſt thoſe mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes wherein choler may ingage a Prince, the provoking a Potent King to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare War againſt him, is one of the moſt dangerous; War is never to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken in Paſſion, but to be entred into by the Gate of Prudence, elſe it turneth to the Adventurers ruine. Anger tranſporteth a Prince without giving him leave to compare his Forces with his enemies, without preparing means neceſſary for his defence, or obtaining an happy end, and without any thoughts of deſiſting, or of making any advantagious Peace; but having haſtily taken up his Sword, he is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes ſeen to let it fall with repentance, though too late, becauſe ſuch heady
<pb n="554" facs="tcp:56802:283"/>reſolutions can hardly reſtore him to his firſt ſtate. He that hath once ſet a fire on a Forreſt, is no more able to extinguiſh it, but it runs from Tree to Tree until it hath conſumed all, nay hardly will it be quench'd upon the borders, and that Prince who hath once kindled a War cannot extinguiſh it at his pleaſure, nor can he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the ruines, which by little and little attend it, or keep it back from doing all manner of out-rages in his own country. Well may Paſſion ingage the weakeſt, but being once heated, it belongeth to the Victorious to renounce it. There are many Princes, ſaith <hi>Polybius,</hi> who egg'd on by an impetuous violence, either to revenge themſelves, or grow great, do attempt many things; but few there are who know rightly how to conduct their enterprizes to obtain an happy end, or have underſtanding or induſtry ſufficient to vanquiſh the reſiſtances of fortune.</p>

                  <p>Merchants uſed to Traffique in an Enemies Country, are not improper for this purpoſe, in regard of their general acquaintance, as <hi>Xenophon,</hi> one of the ableſt Stateſmen of his time, hath declared; but one thing eſpecially ought to be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in employing ſuch perſons, that is, that they be men of underſtanding and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity; for if they be defective in the former, their advices will not only be frivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, but hurtfull; becauſe they may ingage reſolutions contrary to what is fit: and if they be deficient in the latter, it is eaſie to conclude how dangerouſly inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent it may be. As to the means which all in general are to uſe for their informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, none are better, then thoſe which ingage men to talk much, and diſcover them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: Anger hath been ever eſteemed a fit ſubject to work upon, becauſe it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priveth the uſe of reaſon, and giveth only the tongue liberty; and therefore it would not be amiſſe that an Embaſſadour ſhould dextrouſly provoke an Enemy-Prince, or his Miniſters, to drive them into this Paſſion; however this ought to be managed both with ingenuity and reſpect, leſt he ſo far exaſperate them, as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe him any more audience. It will not a little conduce to this end, to viſit ſuch Grandees of State, who they find talkative; it being uſual with great talkers, to let fall whatever is in their thoughts, juſt as Torrents hurry away all that oppoſe
<pb n="556" facs="tcp:56802:284"/>them. Ladies are very proper to diſcover ſecrets, eſpecially where a man may partake of their favours. For this reaſon did <hi>Augustus</hi> uſually make love to his Enemies Wives; and indeed, it is impoſſible the ſhould keep any thing ſecret from their Gallants: Nor ought they to be defective in feaſting thoſe who know the Country, becauſe Wine is as much an enemy to a ſecret, as love; but eſpecially money makes the Mare go. That is it which diſcovereth all, and was one of the means uſed by that great Captain <hi>Gonzalvus,</hi> to inform himſelf of all his Maſters enemies affairs, during his abode in <hi>Naples,</hi> as was to be ſeen in his account after the War, where to this end he had ſpent 600494 crowns.</p>

                  <head>The King ſendeth the <hi>Sieur de la Nauve,</hi> to ſeiz upon <hi>Bar,</hi> for defect of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, and to re-unite to the Crown all his loſt Royalties.</head>
                  <p>THe King intending to be reveng'd on <hi>Monſieur de Lorrain,</hi> thought good to begin it by ſeizing upon <hi>Bar,</hi> as the beſt remedy, in hopes that by letting him ſee his Majeſties reſolution, no longer to indure the effects of his hatred; he would, in fine, return to his duty without ingaging himſelf in greater extremities. Upon this deſign he cauſed him to be ſummoned to the Parliament of <hi>Paris,</hi> to try whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the ſaid Dutchy were not laps'd to the Crown for default of Homage, upon whoſe non-appearance the Parliament decreed by the Judgement of the 30. of <hi>July.</hi> that a Commiſſion ſhould be iſſued out to the Attorney General to ſeiz upon it, and deliver it into his Majeſties hands, together with its dependances, untill the ſaid Duke ſhould do his Homage. In proſecution of this Decree, the Parliament gave a Commiſſion to the <hi>Sieur de la Nauve,</hi> one of their moſt ancient Counſellors, whoſe ability in learning, experience in affairs, and integrity in the Adminiſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Juſtice, together with his birth and manners, were thought capable enough to cauſe his Majeſties name to be honoured in <hi>Bar,</hi> and to re-eſtabliſh his Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in that luſtre, of which <hi>Monſieur de Lorrain</hi>'s Ambition had deprived him. His Majeſty approved of their choice; and the <hi>Sieur de la Nauve,</hi> going to take his leave of his Majeſty, and receive the honour of his commands; he gave them another Commiſſion, under the Great Seal, not only to execute the Parliaments Decree, but alſo to re-unite unto the Crown, the Royal Prerogatives of <hi>Bar,</hi> the grant of which had heretofore been made by <hi>Charles</hi> the Ninth, and <hi>Henry</hi> the Third, to the then Duke <hi>Lorrain,</hi> without mature conſideration of the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of ſuch alienation. Theſe things thus ended, the <hi>Sieur de la Nauve,</hi> bent all his thought towards <hi>Bar,</hi> together with ſuch Officers, as the Parliament doth uſually appoint to attend upon their Commiſſaries on ſuch occaſions. The Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of the City receiv'd him with all honour, but not long after his arrival, the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron <hi>de Couuonges,</hi> Bayliff and Governour of <hi>Bar,</hi> came to meet him on the behalf of the Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> to intreat him to deliver him a Copy of his Commiſſion, aſſuring him in the interim, that the Duke had given leave to all the inhabitants and Officers of the City, to obey ſuch commands as he had brought from his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, it being the order of Soveraignty, that the weaker ſhould obey the ſtronger. This diſcourſe did not at all ſurpriſe him, he knowing, that ſuch an affair could not be ended without ſome conteſt; and accordingly, bee anſwered the Baron <hi>de Couuanges</hi> without any alteration, that his Commiſſion being to be executed in publick, and himſelf being to be there in the head of his Officers, as Bayliff of <hi>Bar,</hi> to underſtand the King and Parliaments pleaſure, it would be unneceſſary to give him a copy thereof, and that it appertained not to the Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> to give leave to the Officers and Inhabitants of <hi>Bar</hi> to obey his Majeſties commands, ſeeing they having no other Soveraign but his Majeſty, no one could have the power to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt them from that duty which they owed him. The <hi>Sieur de Couuonges,</hi> upon this anſwer, withdrew; and the next morning, the <hi>Sieur de la Nauve</hi> going to the Palace where the Officers of Juſtice were aſſembled, took his place, and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed his Commiſſion to be read unto them, which impowered him to ſeiz the Dutchy
<pb n="557" facs="tcp:56802:284"/>of <hi>Bar</hi> for his Majeſty, for default of Homage, and to re-unite unto the Crown, the rights of Royalty and Soveraignty, which had heretofore been alienated, and which a ſubject guilty of Felony could not juſtly injoy; that to this end, he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled to alter the Titles of Juſtice, to ordain that all ſucceeding Acts ſhould paſſe in his Majeſties name, that they ſhould be ſealed with his Arms; that all the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of <hi>Bar</hi> ſhould have recourſe to his Majeſty, for Letters of Juſtice and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of Pardon and Grace; that the money ſhould be hereafter ſtamp'd with the Arms of <hi>France;</hi> and that in general, the ſame Orders ſhould be eſtabliſhed among them, as were obſerved in the other Provinces of <hi>France.</hi> Then he told them, he thought it unneceſſary to exhort them to be obedient unto his Majeſty, ſeeing they were his Subjects born, and that it could not but be glorious for them, to be under a Prince who had taken Juſtice for the rule of his actions; who for his Clemency, is beloved by his people; and who for his Valour, is honoured of all the World; that the ſeizure of <hi>Bar</hi> ought to ſeem the leſſe ſtrange unto them, in regard the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> his Majeſties Subject and Vaſſal, in relation to this Dutchy, which belonged in Fee to the Crown, had failed to do his Fealty and Homage, though by the cuſtomes of <hi>France,</hi> none but his Majeſty could re-inſtall him in it; that his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty had for ten years paſt, expected his ſubmiſſion, though he might lawfully have ſeiz'd it upon the death of the late Duke; and that this Law of Fealty, ſhould be the more vigorouſly executed, as to the Dukes of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> in regard they had of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten failed to do their duties unto his Majeſty. As to that which concerned the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uniting of the Regal Rights to the Crown of <hi>France;</hi> he added, that thoſe Rights being, as it were, a Flower, extracted from that Crown, by the importunities of the Dukes of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> it was the more equitable to re-unite them, and deprive the Duke of them, becauſe he hath ſo far abuſed them, that he wanted little of a total uſurpation, without conſidering how our Kings have reſerved the laſt appeal, and Homage, as ſo many marks of Soveraign Authority, not to be alienated, that there was little reaſon to ſuffer them longer in his hands, who had for ſo many years to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether delayed and refuſed to do homage for them; and indeavoured to perſwade the World, that thoſe perform'd by his Predeceſſors, were but ſo many viſits and complements; eſpecially conſidering, that bounty hath its limits, as well as Juſtice; and that it is taken for a diſhonourable weakneſſe in Kings, when it is exceſſive, or when it perſwadeth them to put up abuſes offered unto them. In fine, he ordered that the Dutchy of <hi>Bar</hi> ſhould be ſeized and delivered into his Majeſties hands, and that the Royal Prerogatives ſhould be re-united to the Crown of <hi>France,</hi> by the Meſſengers of the Parliament, who accompanied him to be injoyed by his Majeſty, untill he had receiv'd ſatisfaction in the cauſes of the ſeizure. This was the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of his diſcourſe at the Palace. In the following days, he cauſe his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to be read in the Bayliffs court, in the chamber of Accompts, and the Town-Houſe. The Meſſengers of the Parliament executed the Decree, all the Officers took the Oath of Allegiance unto his Majeſty, He did ſeveral acts of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, required the Clergy to make publick Prayers for his Majeſty and the Royal Family, inhibited all Gentlemen and inhabitants of <hi>Bar,</hi> to bear Arms for the Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> regulated ſome diſorders committed by the Provoſts of Mareſchals, in the exerciſe of their Office; and in general, ſetled every thing which he thought conducing to his Majeſties ſervice.</p>

                  <head>That Kings never ought to alienate their Demeſnes, eſpecially their rights of Soveraignty.</head>
                  <p>THough Liberality be ſo becomming Kings, that it is no leſſe beſeeming them to give, then to command, yet ought they never to extend their bounties ſo far, as to alienate their Demeſnes. The Revenues of the crown, do chiefly contain two things, the rights of Soveraignty, and the lands which they have reſerved to themſelves, or acquired by any other way whatever. The rights
<pb n="558" facs="tcp:56802:285"/>of Soveraignty, conſiſt in the power of executing Juſtice, coyning of money, gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of Pardons, making Peace and War, eſtabliſhing Laws, impoſing Taxes, crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Magiſtrates, and ſending Embaſſadours. As for Demeſne Lands, as it is impoſſible to ſupport the charges of State, without a certain income, Kings have alwaies reſerved ſome of this ſort, beſide their Soveraignty, to ſerve their occaſions. This Demeſne, though of leſſe honour, hath ever been eſteemed ſo ſacred, that Kings at their Coronations have ſworn to preſerve and defend them to the utmoſt of their powers. Indeed it is impoſſible, as <hi>Tacitus</hi> obſerveth, to keep a people in quiet without Arms, Arms without Money, and Money without Revenue or Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute. Hence it was, that <hi>Nero</hi> having deliberated how to aboliſh all the Tolls of the Kingdom, the Senate though they approved of his Magnificence, yet could not give their aſſents unto that; becauſe the ruine of the Empire would be inevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, when the Nerves of it ſhould be ſo deſtroyed. If the alienation of ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Lands and Tributes, be ſo prejudicial to States, thoſe of Soveraign rights are incomparably more conſiderable and dangerous. Theſe latter Rights are like the Rays of the Sun, inſeparable from the Royal Family, and like the moſt noble parts of the Kingdom, without which it cannot be preſerved in that ſtrength which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes it. That of the Law, which inhibiteth the alienation of royal Prerogatives, ought to be underſtood more in relation of thoſe, then of Lands; and thereupon hath ordained, that if any thing be alienated or diſmembred, it ſhall notwithſtanding be re-united to the Crown, as ſo many diſtracted members to their body, to reſtore it to its former ſtrength. This hath been alwaies ſo exactly obſerved in this Kingdom, that in the very Penſions of the Sons of <hi>France,</hi> the Demeſnes of the Crown are never a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lienated, but with expreſſe reſervation of reverting to the Crowns, when the Males fail, and that without any right of Soveraignty; ſo that to grant ſuch royal Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives to a Forraigner, were to treat them more favourably, then the Princes of the royal family; and withall, to indanger a loſs of their Soveraignty. Ambition hath no bounds, and a Prince who hath obtained the priviledge of ſome Soveraignties, may be eaſily wrought upon, at leaſt his Succeſſors, to pretend to them, without and depending upon others; ſo that who ſo is peccant in this exceſſe of Liberality, what doth he but raiſe a power againſt his own, and ſow the ſeeds of diviſion in his Kingdom. Beſides, States be not ſo much for Kings, as Kings for their States, they are no leſſe oblig'd to preſerve them in all their dependances, then the State is obliged to preſerve it ſelf in the obedience they ow them; from whence it is, that to alienate ſuch rights, or any notable part of their Demeſne, is one of the cauſes of their depoſing, in thoſe Kingdomes where it is permitted by the Fundamental Laws, as is obſerved by all thoſe who have written on that Subject; and indeed, he ſeemeth to be unworthy of a Crown, who neglecteth to preſerve it in its intire luſtre.</p>

                  <head>How the Cardinal <hi>de Lorrain</hi> came to meet the King at <hi>Chaſteauthierry,</hi> where his Majeſty ſtayed to demand <hi>Nancy</hi> in Depoſite.</head>
                  <p>IT had been not only commendable but advantagious to <hi>Monſieur de Lorrain,</hi> to have been more concern'd at the ſeizure at <hi>Bar,</hi> and to have waited upon his Majeſty to do him homage, and ſatisfie the juſt diſcontents conceived againſt him by his ſubmiſſions; but fortune contriving to deſtroy him, had caſt her Mantle before his eyes, ſo that the continued immoveable in his firſt deſigns. Whereupon his Majeſty, about <hi>Auguſt,</hi> found himſelf obliged to go to <hi>Chaſteau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thierry,</hi> from thence to meet the Army, which he had recall'd from the Country of <hi>Treves,</hi> and to carry them before <hi>Nancy,</hi> the better to hinder the Duke of <hi>Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain's</hi> Levies; and in caſe he perſiſted in his late Procedures, to reduce him to ſuch a paſſe, that he might be no more in a condition of giving any jealouſie to <hi>France,</hi> or interrupting the forces of its Allies. Whiles his Majeſty was at <hi>Chaſteauthierry,</hi> the Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain</hi> came to meet him, and after ſome complements and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſes,
<pb n="559" facs="tcp:56802:285"/>beſeeched his leave to make ſome Propoſitions unto him. He told him, that he did much condemn his brothers actions, and that he had never had any hand in them; both in regard of the reſpect he owed his Majeſty; as alſo becauſe be foreſaw the iſſue could not but be diſadvantagious; that if his Majeſty ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in the reſolution to drive this affair to the utmoſt, he concluded his Brothers ruine inevitable, and that for his own particular fortune, he ſhould ſeek no other refuge but that of his royal bounty, beſeech'd him to receive him into his protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and to permit him to retire into <hi>France.</hi> His Majeſty received him very fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourably, and told him, that he ſhould alwaies know how to diſtinguiſh betwixt his and his Brothers actions; that he was ſufficiently inform'd, that he had no hand in his Brothers deport; and that he ſhould willingly afford him all the proofs of as hearty a good will, as the intereſt of his affairs would permit; that he aſſured him of his protection; and that amidſt his Brothers diſgrace, he ſhould be ſure to find all the advantage which could be juſtly deſired from his protection. The Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal <hi>de Lorrain,</hi> would have made hereupon certain Propoſals to his Majeſty for the accommodation of affairs, which his Majeſty remitted to <hi>Monſieur</hi> the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal. The ſame day the Cardinal <hi>de Lorrain,</hi> went to viſit <hi>Monſieur le</hi> Cardinal, aſſured him of <hi>Monſieurs</hi> marriage, propoſed to him to break it, to put his ſiſter, the Princeſſe <hi>Marguerite</hi> into his Majeſties hands, and to cauſe the homage of the Dutchy of <hi>Bar,</hi> to be payed unto his Majeſty in the Dutcheſſe of <hi>Lorrain's</hi> name. The Cardinal anſwered him, that the King could not give ear to any propoſition, ſeeing the breach of that match was not in the power of <hi>Monſieur de Lorrain;</hi> that beſides his ſo little fidelity in obſerving the three Treaties lately made with him; his Majeſty had particular information of his evil conduct, and could no longer truſt him without ſome more potent means to oblige him to keep his word; that his faltrings, had three ſeveral times conſtrained his Majeſty to raiſe great Armies, to the great and trouble expence of his Subjects, which made his Majeſty reſolve to put a final end to the War, that there might be no more trouble in it; that the Duke his Brother might not have the boldneſſe to intermeddle in any factions of his State, as he had formerly done, even to the ingaging of <hi>Monſieur</hi> in a match, which did equally offend the dignity of the Crown and Perſon of his Majeſty, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing managed without his conſent, againſt the Laws of the Kingdom, and to the countenancing of his invading <hi>France;</hi> and that the only means which could in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce his Majeſty to truſt the Duke his Brother, was to Depoſit <hi>Nancy</hi> in his hands, that this was the beſt courſe he could take, ſeeing it would preſerve his Country; and that <hi>Nancy</hi> it ſelf, ſhould be aſſuredly reſtored unto him, if he carried himſelf for the future, as did become him; that in caſe he intended fairly, he need not fear any thing; but if on the contrary, he was reſolv'd to perſiſt in attempts againſt his Majeſty, it would be to no purpoſe to treat; that his Majeſty was poſitively reſolved, to admit of no other conditions; and that <hi>Monſieur de Lorrain</hi> ought to make the leſſe difficulty to conſent thereunto, in regard he was deſpoiled of all his Eſtates, excepting <hi>Nancy</hi> it ſelf, the loſſe of which would be unavoidable, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe he gave his Majeſty ſatisfaction; that this place indeed was ſtrong, but that the Duke being unable to keep the field, and without Revenue, his Majeſty would the more eaſily force him to ſurrender it, in regard he might manage the War againſt him at his own charges; that to ground his hopes upon the alteration of times, was a counſel very pernicious, ſeeing his Majeſty was young, abſolute in his Kingdom; and that his cauſe being juſt there was reaſon to hope that God would continue to proſper his Armies with the like happy ſucceſſe, as he had hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto done. Hereupon the Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> repreſented to him that this condition was ſo hard, that he could not adviſe his brother to accept of it; but at the laſt extremity, ſeeing the chance of War could not reduce him to a worſe paſs then to ſee his Captal City taken from him, and forced to depend upon anothers Will; That he doubted not of his Majeſties intention to perform the truſt of a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſit; but that the ſtate of affairs being ſubject to change, his enemies might by
<pb n="560" facs="tcp:56802:286"/>their ill Offices make his Majeſty believe that he had broken the Treaty; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently, give him occaſion to detain <hi>Nancy;</hi> that he beſeeched the Cardinal to conſider what a ſhame it would be for his brother to deliver up one of the beſt places in the World, in the ſight of all <hi>Europe,</hi> without reſiſtance, and not being forced thereunto; that he confeſs'd his Majeſties Power was great, and that it would be difficult for him to withſtand it; and that finding himſelf between two great Princes, he ought to be the more cautious of his deportment, in regard if he ſhould ſatisfie the King by delivering <hi>Nancy,</hi> he ſhould contract the Emperour's diſpleaſure, from whom he holdeth his Dutchy, which doubtleſſe he would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare to be forfeited by Proclamation of the Empire, with a reſolution to ſeiz up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it as ſoon as ever the affairs of <hi>Germany</hi> would permit him; That indeed he might reaſonably expect his Majeſties protection, but that then it might ſo fall out that his Majeſty might be ſo far ingaged in other Wars, as not to be in a condition of aſſiſting him, by which means his ruine would then be inevitable; and more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, that he thought it impoſſible to perſwade his brother to Depoſit <hi>Nancy,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe at the laſt extremity of his affairs. Whereunto the Cardinal anſwered, that he found it not ſtrange that he ſhould alledge his holding of the Empire, and the power of the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria;</hi> but beſides that, the King did not conſider ſuch pretenſions, he thought that if the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> did well weigh it, he would find no great reaſon to build upon it, becauſe he well knew that thoſe whoſe inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts he alledged, being the chief Authors of his evil conduct, had not been very ſolicitous to aſſiſt him: That he confeſs'd indeed <hi>Monſieur de Lorrain</hi> was under the P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>otection of two Crowns; but that the Laws of the very protection, obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged him to deſerve it from the King, by his reſpects and good deportment; and to conclude, by the deſires which his Predeceſſors had teſtified, that his preſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on intirely depended thereupon: That inſtead thereof he had provok'd his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, broken his faith by infringing of Treaties, taken part with <hi>Spain,</hi> run into all acts of Hoſtility, and to compleat all the reſt of his breaches of promiſe which might offend his Majeſty, had raviſh'd a ſon of <hi>France,</hi> and ingag'd <hi>Monſieur</hi> to marry his ſiſter, whereupon his Majeſty had but too much reaſon to invade his Countries; and that if he did more fear the power of the Emperour, then that of <hi>France,</hi> then at his Gates, he might chuſe what party he pleaſed to defend himſelf by force; but that in caſe he would prudently avoid his ruine, which was inevita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, he could not take a better courſe, then by depoſiting of <hi>Nancy,</hi> which would ſecure his States without any loſs to him.</p>
                  <p>As for matter of his holding of the Empire, the King was far enough from ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting it, ſeeing he himſelf claimeth the Soveraignty of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> and that the Homage was due unto him; that the Empire had heretofore uſurp'd it from this Crown, but that length of poſſeſſion could not prejudice a Soveraigns right, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe great Princes, who acknowledge no other Tribunal upon earth, where they may claim their own, are alwaies permitted to demand their rights from Uſurpers, and to enter them by force; ſo that no time can cauſe a preſcription againſt them; that the affairs of <hi>France</hi> had not heretofore been in a condition to diſpute theſe pretences; but that now God having opened his Majeſty a way to eſtabliſh his Monarchy, in its primitive greatneſſe, Poſterity would have a juſt cauſe to reproach him with negligence, if he ſhould not imploy his forces in the recovery of the moſt ancient rights of his Crown: that <hi>Monſieur de Lorrain</hi> ought to have had thoſe fears alledged by him in his mind, at ſuch time as he was running on to provoke his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty againſt him, but that now having done the injury, his Majeſty could not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble his reſentment: wherefore he was abſolutely reſolved to be reveng'd unleſs he receiv'd ſuch ſatisfaction that all <hi>Europe</hi> might know to be reaſonable: that his P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>edeceſſors had ever well-eſteem'd the friendſhip of <hi>France,</hi> and that he himſelf might have reſted ſecure in this protection, becauſe his Majeſty well knew how to defend him againſt any man: But in fine, that the King could not admit of any other condition then the Depoſite of <hi>Nancy,</hi> ſeeing though he already had the
<pb n="561" facs="tcp:56802:286"/>beſt places of <hi>Lorrain</hi> in his hands, they could not oblige the Duke to keep his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, and that his Majeſty had reaſon to ſuſpect he would not be much more ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citous for keeping it in future, after ſo many changes of his reſolution: that his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty chiefly deſired this aſſurance, that he might no more hazard the receiving a new injury, or be neceſſitated (to his great expence) to raiſe a new Army: a thing, peradventure, which might then fall out when the State of his affairs would hardly permit him to attend it, whereas the preſent conjuncture was ſuch, that his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty could not wiſh it more favourable, there being no likelyhood of any thing to divert him; that the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> might be thereby the more readily induc'd to this reſolution; his Majeſty deſired to inform him of the preſent ſtate of his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs; that that of <hi>France</hi> was ſuch, that it was not only at Peace, but without fear of civil War, all ill Subjects conſpiring to be obedient, the Treaſure being full of money to ſuſtain the charge; and on the other ſide, the Treaty of the Low Countries being broken, without the leaſt hopes of being brought on again, and the Spaniards being in ſo much want of aſſiſtance from their Allies; that the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> could not pretend to expect any from them. As to <hi>Germany,</hi> that the Emperours forces had enough to do, to defend themſelves from the proſperous ſucceſſe of the <hi>Swede,</hi> who was not likely to be ſtopp'd. As to matter of <hi>Italy,</hi> that the Cardinal <hi>Infanta</hi>'s forces; were not yet ready to march, and that admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting they were, yet that they might meet with great obſtructions in the <hi>Valtoline,</hi> the Swedes being advanced thither to hinder their march; and that thus <hi>Nancy</hi> might be beſieg'd, and taken without hopes of any aſſiſtance to releeve it, unleſſe <hi>Monſieur de Lorrain,</hi> had rather Depoſite it in his Majeſties hands. The Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal <hi>de Lorrain</hi> found it an hard task to anſwer theſe reaſons, and being retired, all the courſe he took was to beſeech his Majeſty, to give him time to confer with the Duke his brother; and in the mean time, not to make any further progreſſe. The King not only refus'd it, but aſſur'd that he would march before <hi>Nancy,</hi> with the greateſt ſpeed that might be, reſolv'd never to depart, until he had reduc'd it to its obedience.</p>

                  <p>IT is neceſſary to take other kind of ſecurity then bare words, from a Prince who hath often failed of his word, &amp; eſpecially, who is known to be incens'd, &amp; paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately deſirous of revenging the puniſhments he hath receiv'd. His apparent ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions in matters of accommodation, are effects rather of his weakneſs then good wil; and as Paſſion rather treadeth under foot the Laws of honor and juſtice, it will after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards make no difficulty to break its promiſes, if it find any overture to evade them, and re-aſſume its loſt advantage. <hi>Aſdrubal</hi> may ſerve for an example, who finding himſelf ſo block'd up in <hi>Spain,</hi> by <hi>Claudius Nero,</hi> that he muſt unavoidably die with famine in his Trenches, or fall under his Arms in a diſadvantagious battel, ſent him very fair Propoſals of Peace, and in the interim, found away to eſcape his hand. <hi>Nero</hi> indeed angry for being thus ſurprized, for which he had been blam'd at <hi>Rome,</hi> made him afterwards ſuffer in the Marquiſate of <hi>Ancona</hi> for his Treachery; but beſides, that this was not without indangering his whole Army, yet had it been a ſhame to ſuffer himſelf to be deluded by his enemy, under ſhew of accommodati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Pope <hi>Julius</hi> the Second, that he might amuſe <hi>Lewis</hi> the Twelfth, ſent his Nuncio's to Treat a Peace, and conclude it, that he might gain time to make a League offenſive with the Venetians and King of <hi>Aragon</hi> aginſt him; but let us look back again into the examples of Antiquity. <hi>Mark Anthony,</hi> held <hi>Fraates</hi> beſieged in <hi>Priaſpe</hi> with full aſſurance of taking it in few days. <hi>Fraates</hi> ſent his Embaſſadours to him, that it was thought a Peace might eaſily have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
<pb n="562" facs="tcp:56802:287"/>between them. <hi>Mark Anthony</hi> gave them preſent Audience, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, ſent other Embaſſadour to <hi>Fraates</hi> to conclude it; but <hi>Fraates</hi> continuing his Treachery, made great complaints unto them of <hi>Mark Anthony;</hi> and in conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, added, that as often as he ſhould withdraw his Army, from the place where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he was incamp'd, he would be content to make a Peace with him. <hi>Mark An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony</hi> hereupon preſently withdrew his Forces, without breaking down his Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, or carrying away his Engines of War, he had not march'd far from his Camp, before the <hi>Medes</hi> ſallied out of <hi>Priaſpe,</hi> maſtered it, and deſtroyed all his Engines, which he had inconſiderately left there, though peradventure not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hopes that he might be there ſoon enough to defend them, in caſe the <hi>Medes</hi> u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed any Treachery.

                  <head>How the Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain</hi> came to meet his Majeſty at <hi>St. Dezier,</hi> and made divers Propoſitions which <hi>Monſieur</hi> the Cardinal refuſed.</head>
                  <p>THe Cardinal <hi>de Lorrain,</hi> took his leave of the King upon the 20. of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> to meet his brother, and the ſame day, his Majeſty, who ſeldom loſeth any time in ſuch enterprizes, advanc'd towards <hi>Nancy;</hi> but being neer St. <hi>Dezier,</hi> the Cardinal returned to him, and offered in the Duke of <hi>Lorrain's</hi> name, to deliver the Princeſſe <hi>Marguerite</hi> his Siſter into his hands, in order to the diſſolution of that marriage, and to ſurrender <hi>La Mothe</hi> unto him, one of the ſtrongeſt places of his State. The King carried him to <hi>St. Dezier,</hi> and had two hours conference with him, at which <hi>Monſieur le Cardinal Duc,</hi> the <hi>Sieur de Braſſac Bullion,</hi> and <hi>Bouthilier</hi> were preſent to examine the Propoſitions; but they were thought im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper, becauſe they did not deprive the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> of the power to re-aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume his former deſigns; ſo that his Majeſty return'd him no other anſwer, but this, that he was reſolv'd to have <hi>Nancy,</hi> as a place without which he had no aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance for the performance of any Treaty; however, his Majeſty knowing that the Cardinals negotiations were very frank and affectionate to procure an accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation; he teſtified unto him, that his inter poſition was not only acceptable, but that he had ever a regard to his particular intereſt, notwithſtanding the inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries he had receiv'd from his Brother; and withall, offered him all ſorts of honour and imployments ſuitable to his quality, if he thought good to reſide in <hi>France.</hi> After this he returned to the Duke his brother, to acquaint him with the Kings re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution; and having told him what extraordinary teſtimonies of favour and good will he had receiv'd from his Majeſty; the Duke at laſt reſolved to ſurrender his Eſtates into the Kings hands, hoping by this means to evade the effects of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties juſt diſpleaſure, yet took aſſurance from the Cardinal his brother, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore them unto him. He diſcourſed of it with the Cardinal, who having aſſured him, that he would therein do whatever could be deſired; he beſeeched him to return to the King, to tell him, that ſeeing he was ſo unfortunate, that his Majeſty could not beleeve his promiſes, he had reſolv'd to put his eſtates, into his Brother the Cardinals hands; and that he hop'd his Majeſty conſidering his deportment, whould the more readily conſent thereunto, becauſe then there was no cauſe of fear, and that he could not receive a greater ſatisfaction from him, then to ſee him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd to the quality of a private perſon, by deveſting himſelf from that of a Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign. The Cardinal <hi>de Lorrain,</hi> return'd to his Majeſty at <hi>Pont au Mouſſon,</hi> upon the 28. of the ſame moneth, and propoſed this to him, renewing his promiſed of delivering the Princeſſe <hi>Marguerite</hi> into his hands, and ſo to indeavour the diſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that marriage. The King deſir'd him to treat with <hi>Monſieur</hi> the Cardinal,
<pb n="563" facs="tcp:56802:287"/>relying upon this grand Miniſter, whom he knew to employ moſt of his time in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination of what might be granted, and in prevention of ſuch inconveniences as might probably ariſe from their Propoſitions. The Cardinal <hi>de Lorrain</hi> went to meet him, and made the ſame Propoſition unto him, and withall told him, that to give him the greater aſſurance of his fidelity, and of his poſitive intention to keep his word; he beſeeched him to give him Made <hi>de Combalet</hi> his Neece in marriage, and to procure the Kings conſent unto it, profeſſing that he deſired it with a great deal of affection, as a moſt certian gage of his good will, and a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfull means to preſerve him in his Majeſties favour, and proteſted totally to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace his counſels, and to have no other will then his, whereby he might abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely root out all ſubject of diviſion between <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Lorrain. Monſieur</hi> the Cardinal replied unto him, that as for matter of the ſurrender of the States of <hi>Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain,</hi> he beleeved the King would not divert his brother from it, ſeeing his parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular actions gave ſufficient ground to beleeve his behaviour toward <hi>France,</hi> would be ſuch as would give his Majeſty all kind of ſatisfaction; but that this was not to cure the diſeaſe, becauſe <hi>M. de Lorrain,</hi> might repent of his ſurrender, and return into his ſtates, either by open force, or under-hand dealing, and that then the whole buſineſſe were to be begun again; wherefore it were neceſſary to find out another expedient, and that the Depoſite of <hi>Nancy,</hi> was the only ſecure way which could be taken. This was ſufficient to let him know, that it was miſtruſted, leſt there were ſome colluſion between them; but that he might not exaſperate him, and preſerve him affectionate to the accommodation, whereby ſome advantage might be made upon the concluſion, he would not harp any more upon that ſtring. As to his demand of Madam <hi>de Combalet,</hi> he told him, that he took it for a very great honour, and did not reject it, but that he thought it improper to treat of it at that time, to avoid the report of having ingag'd his Majeſty to come into <hi>Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain</hi> with a great Army for his private ends, and intreated him not to inſert this affair with the publick, though for his part he was not waies averſe from it. Theſe words of agreement, were only an effect of his Purdence, which adviſed him not to eſtrange this Cardinals good will, but to preſerve it to be made uſe of as occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion ſhould require, for diſcourſing to the chief Miniſters concerning this Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; he told them, that neither the preſent, nor the future age, ſhould have cauſe to believe, that he had mingle his own intereſts in this affair, where his only end was the Kings ſervice, and the good of the State; that heretofore the Cardinal <hi>de Amboiſe,</hi> had made <hi>Lewis</hi> the Twelfth undertake a War in <hi>Italy,</hi> only upon an ambitious deſign of being Pope; but that for his part, he ſhould alwaies ſhun the blame of managing the affairs of State by his own particular Intereſt, and as to that which concern'd the Princeſſe <hi>Marguerite,</hi> he aſſured him that the King would willingly accept thereof; any that the executing of it would give a great ſtroke to a concluſion, ſeeing ſhe might much diſpoſe his Majeſty to relinquiſh ſomewhat of his reſolution, becauſe he could not but receive her as a pledge of <hi>Monſieur de Lorrain's</hi> good inclination to be at peace with his Majeſty; but he told him, that his Majeſty beleeved it was not in their power, for that he was inform'd of what had paſt. The Cardinal <hi>de Lorrain</hi> made himſelf ingnorant, and aſſured the Cardinal ſhe was in a place where they could diſpoſe of her; but that only ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to make the Cardinal diſtruſt his intentions, who knoweth, that in matters of Treaty, an enemies actions are more to be regarded them his words. After this, they brake up their conference, departed each from other, and the next morning the Cardinal <hi>de Lorrain</hi> took his leave of the King.</p>

                  <head>That a wiſe Minister ought to foreſee the inconveniences of all Propoſitions made to him in Treaties.</head>
                  <p>It is the property of a wiſe Miniſter, to foreſee the inconveniences of ſuch Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions as are made in Treaties to ſurprize him, and to be carefull that an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my who hath not been able to get any advantage by War, ſhould not gain it by an accommodation. It is to this end that many have thought Prudence to be more neceſſary for him then valour, becauſe the occaſions of fighting are but ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in War, whereas Propoſitions of Peace are daily made, which if he ſhould admit of to his Maſters detriment, would be no leſſe prejudicial to him then a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat. To ſpeak truth, this vertue is as needfull for him, as Art for a Work-man, and as the ignorant Workman doth only ſpoil that ſubſtance, which he pretendeth to form; ſo the imprudent Miniſter ruineth the affairs of a State, if he accept of injurious conditions for want of fore-ſeeing the conſequences. Prudence it is which cauſeth him to know the means by which he may attain his propoſed end, preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth his being deceived, ſerveth to regulate his counſels, guideth his actions, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth him ſpeak in agreeable terms, conducteth all his motions, teacheth him what to do in all Occurrences, maketh him clear ſighted amidſt the Artifices of his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and giveth him addreſſe to obtain whatever he deſires. The Philoſopher ſaith, it is a virtue proper to him that governeth, not that it is unneceſſary for pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate perſons; but becauſe it is ſo highly neceſſary for Kings and Miniſters, that without it they are no more able to govern a State, than a Pilot to guide his Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel without Steer and Rudder. He who is Maſter of it, doth eaſily maſter all others in matters of negotiation; and if his birth hath not made him a Soveraign, yet doth it afford him the means to work Soveraigns to what he pleaſeth; ſo ſaith the wiſe man in his Proverbs, <hi>The pleaſure of a King dependeth upon the Prudence of his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant.</hi> To make a right uſe of this vertue, he ought adviſedly to conſider the parts which are propoſed to him, and to bring them to the Touch-ſtone of thoſe maximes which he hath laid down for the ground of the Treaty. To this end, the wiſe Miniſter often retires in private, as knowing, that then he hath full liberty to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſe the Propoſitions made unto him, and is at leiſure to conſider them; a thing, ſaith <hi>Periander,</hi> able to overcome all things. He is not ignorant, that who ſo taketh reſolutions without due conſideration, is like thoſe liquoriſh men, who charging their ſtomacks over haſtily, do repent it as ſoon as they riſe from the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; wherefore he taketh great care to weigh the Propoſitions made to him, he applieth the <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> to the <hi>Theſis,</hi> particular affairs, to general maximes; he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collecteth the Experience of things paſt, proportioneth the means to the end, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerveth if by granting any thing, it may not ſerve the enemy to obtain his preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, examineth what aſſurance he ſhall find of performance, and generally all other circumſtances: And laſtly, being thus ſecure from all ſurprizes, he is not only in a condition of being not cheated, but in a way of obtaining whatever he deſireth.</p>

The Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <hi>de Florinville,</hi> deſigning to get in by night, was led by <hi>M. de Lorrains</hi> Huntſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men though Woods, and by unknown waies; yet they could not carry it ſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly, but ſome French diſcovered them, which ſtrook them into ſuch fear, that flying back again through the ſame Woods, they totally routed themſelves. On the other ſide, the <hi>Comte de la Souze,</hi> kept the Field with ſeven Cornets of horſe, and ſome foot, ſo that nothing durſt appear againſt him: and to re-inforce the Dukes fear, at the advantages which the Kings army took, his Majeſty command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Marſhal <hi>de la Force</hi> to purſue him, with 6000 foot, 1500 horſe, and ſix pieces of Canon, and to inveſt him in any place where he ſhould retreat; and withall, to treat thoſe as enemies who ſhould receive him, if they refuſed to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver him, as an enemy of <hi>France;</hi> ſo that he was conſtrained to retire about <hi>Eſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,</hi> where he quartered with ſuch Forces as he could get together, and to draw a little nearer to the <hi>Franche-Comte,</hi> where they who had perſwaded him to take the Field, gave him incouragement to hope for certain Forces, which never came to him. To be ſhort, that nothing might be omitted which might ſhake him, whom neceſſity alone was able to reduce to reaſon; his Majeſty comming before <hi>Nancy,</hi> and quartering at <hi>Neufville,</hi> went in perſon to view the moſt advantagious Poſts for his Army. The Cardinal likewiſe rid the round without Musquet ſhot of the City, the better of judge of the order of the Siege, and then his Majeſty perſonally drew out the circumvalation, which was four Leagues about the Forts and Redoubts, and ſet the Pioneers to work. He digg'd firſt himſelf, and cauſed the work to be fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed with ſuch care and diligence, that in five days time the Camp was finiſhed, and his under ſhelter. At the ſame time, they began a Bank thwart the River <hi>Meurthe,</hi> which ſtopping the Current, would not only have drowned the neighbouring country, but in a little time have forced in into the City, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled the inhabitants to quit it; inſomuch, that the Duke ſeeing the unhappy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of his affairs, knew not where to hide his head. Every one, in the interim, admired the happy ſucceſſes of thoſe counſels which the Cardinal gave his Majeſty, with ſo much the more aſtoniſhment, in regard they admired upon what ground his Majeſty ſhould reſolve to beſiege one of the ſtrongeſt places of <hi>Europe,</hi> in a ſeaſon ſomewhat forward, without any likelihood of taking it before Winter.</p>

                  <head>That an Enemy in diſorder, ought to be purſued, eſpecially after he hath received a Foil.</head>
                  <p>ONe of the beſt effects of military Prudence, is to know how to take advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of time, how to proſecute an enemy in diſorder, when he hath recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved ſome foil; and hath ſo much to do in ſeveral places, that he is, as it were, neceſſitated to ſubmit and conſent to whatever is deſired. A Prince thus diſorde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, will eaſily grant whatever is demanded of him; and aſſent unto conditions, which at another time he would not. Wherefore it is very expedient in ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juncture, to fall upon him reſolutely, and to purſue him ſo hard, that he may not know which way to turn himſelf. Had <hi>Hannibal</hi> known how to have played his Game after the Battel of <hi>Cannes,</hi> he had forc'd the Romans to receive ſuch conditions as he would have impos'd, it being the greateſt blow their Empire ever felt; but he trifling away his time to refreſh his Souldiers, and injoy the commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diouſneſs
<pb n="566" facs="tcp:56802:289"/>of his Quarters, drowned his Fortune in delights, and made no advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of his good ſucceſſe. A Prince never ought to let good Fortune ſo blind him amidſt his happy ſucceſſes, as to deſpiſe his enemies, or to forbear from proſecuting them to the utmoſt; not that I would adviſe to drive an enemy to extremity, who flies with a great Army, becauſe it might make him couragious, force him to turn about, and as oftentimes it hath happened, to recover the advantage he had loſt, rather he ought to ſet open the Gates, and make a Bridge for him to run away; but otherwiſe it is, if moſt part of his Towns he taken, if he cannot relieve thoſe that are beſieged, if his Forces be not in pieces, and routed in ſeveral places; and if he be ſo ill attended as not to be in a condition of defending himſelf if aſſaulted, then not to proſecute him, were a great overſight to be ſatisfied with half a victory, and to give him time to rally his forces again, were to break all the rules of War. <hi>Caeſar</hi> by his example, ſhew'd all Captains how they ought to behave themſelves on ſuch affairs; never did any thing hinder him in the proſecution of his Victory; but as if Fortune had lent him wings, he flew after his enemies till he had quite de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated them, or obtained ſuch conditions as he demanded. He cannot be ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently commended for his good conduct in <hi>Affrick,</hi> after the defeat of King <hi>Juba, Scipio</hi> and <hi>Afranius,</hi> where ſuch was his good fortune, that he routed them all three in one day, and purſued them ſo ſmartly, that he left neither of them nor their Officers, who was not either killed or taken priſoner, nor any of his Towns, which he did not reduce to his power.</p>

                  <p>THough the Cardinal <hi>de Lorrain</hi> had aſſured his Majeſty that the Princeſſe <hi>Marguerite</hi> was in his diſpoſal; yet it was well known that the Princeſſe <hi>de Falsbourg</hi> her ſiſter, unable to indure the Propoſitions of delivering her into his Majeſties hands, in order to the nulling of her marriage by Law, had found an invention to ſave her, which ſhe had made uſe of with the better effect, in regard Ambition and Love make all things feaſible to women. It was known that ſhe had habited her ſelf like a Cavalier with Boots and Spurs, well horſed; and in this equipage ſhe left <hi>Nancy,</hi> about four of the clock in the morning, attended by a Gentleman, named <hi>Daviſe,</hi> who had heretofore belonged to Madam <hi>de Remire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont,</hi> together with two others, that ſhe paſs'd through divers Sentinels, and that at laſt being ſtopp'd by one, <hi>Daviſe</hi> made him beleeve that they related to the Marqueſſe <hi>de St Chaumont,</hi> and that by this means ſhe had got thirteen Leagues on horſeback; that meeting with certain Swediſh Troops, ſhe had been compell'd to hide her ſelf in a very thick Copſe Wood, where ſhe much ſcratch'd her hands, and that the next morning ſhe got to <hi>Thiomville,</hi> where at firſt they would not open the Gates, and indeed had abſolutely refus'd her, But for the charms of her beauty, which mov'd great compaſſion in thoſe who beheld her lying on the ground wrapp'd up in Clokes, whiles <hi>Daviſe</hi> treated for her admiſſion; and that at laſt being got in, the Governours Wife of the Town had chang'd her habit. From thence ſhe writ to the <hi>Sieur de Puy-Laurens,</hi> to intreat him, to acquaint <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur</hi> with the manner of her eſcape, and that ſhe ſhould ſtay in thoſe places to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect his commands; but afterward thinking it more proper to go to <hi>Namour,</hi> for fear leſt the way might not be open after her eſcape, ſhe reſolv'd to advance thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. His Majeſty receive this news with ſome regret, foreſeeing that her flight might be ſucceeded with troubleſom conſequences, and make the diſſolution of the marriage more difficult: He much blamed the Marqueſſe <hi>de St. Chaumont,</hi> for ſuffering himſelf to be ſurprized, eſpecially after he had been advis'd by the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, to have a great care of all thoſe who ſhould travel upon the Road, becauſe
<pb n="567" facs="tcp:56802:289"/>ſhe might probably paſſe by him in ſome diſguiſe; to which he return'd this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, that they ſhould rely upon his diligence. <hi>Monſieur Duc d'Orleans,</hi> recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved no great ſatisfaction from it, fore-ſeeing that this Princeſs would be a new Obligation to tie him to the Low-Countries; but the Laws of Civility, and the conſideration of the Spaniards, who he was forc'd to content, perſwaded him to ſeem very glad of it. He preſently diſpatch'd the <hi>Sieurs de Fontain Chalendre, de Rames,</hi> and <hi>de Lavaupot</hi> to <hi>Thionville,</hi> who were followed by the Duke <hi>d'Elboeuf,</hi> and the <hi>Sieur de Puy-Laurens;</hi> they met her upon the way, and <hi>Monſieur,</hi> in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, went with much affection to receive her, as far as <hi>Marſhe,</hi> and accompanied her from <hi>Namour</hi> to <hi>Bruxelles,</hi> with all the honour and endearments ſhe could de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire. That day that ſhe was to go into <hi>Bruxelles,</hi> the <hi>Infanta,</hi> with the whole Court went to receive her, half a League from the Town, and meeting, they both aligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from their Coaches to ſalute her; the <hi>Infanta</hi> kiſſed her, and then taking her by the hand, led her into her own Coach, where ſhe alwaies gave her the right hand. Comming to the Gate of <hi>Bruxelles,</hi> the Companies of the City gave her a Volley of ſmall ſhot, and the Magiſtrates went to welcome her; ſhe alighted in company of the <hi>Infanta</hi> at the Queen-Mothers, who teſtified much joy for her arrival, and kiſſed her, and after half an hours entertainment, the <hi>Infanta</hi> carried her to her own lodgings, which ſhe had prepared two dayes before, with very rich Furniture, her ſoul being no leſſe repleniſhed with Magnificence then Piety.

This their violent apprehenſion, augmenteth the fruitfulneſſe of their conceptions; and as the heat of the ayr doth every day diſcloſe new productions in the boſom of the earth; ſo their ardent deſires beget new expedients in their minds, carrieth all their thoughts, conducteth all their motions, guideth all their affections, and ſo diſpoſeth of all their power, that they neither think, deſire, diſcourſe, or do any thing, but what tendeth to their ends; they ſleep with the conſideration of thoſe means which may conduce to their own ends, the deſire of executing them, awakeneth them in the morning; and as they have little diverſions in the day time, they have no greater delight then to diſcourſe with them, in whom they put their confidence. Men who are imploy'd in great affairs, have their imginary faculties more barren, and granting them to be as fertile as thoſe of Ladies, yet the diverſity of their imployments doth ſo divert them, that it is impoſſible for them ever to be ruminating upon the ſame Subject; but otherwiſe it is with Ladies, eſpecially thoſe of quality, who have nothing to do but to pleaſe their own fancies. I might likewiſe adde, that the defect of Prudence,

The Duke came not untill about eleven at night; ſo that finding the Cardinal in bed; and not willing to permit his people to wake him, according as he had command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, they met not untill the morning following.

<pb n="570" facs="tcp:56802:291"/>without any concluſion; ſo that every one thought there would be no agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but in fine, the Duke perſwaded by the Cardinal's eloquence and addreſſe, ſubmitted juſt as his eminence was bidding him <hi>adieu</hi> at his Lodging, and paſs'd his word to conclude the Treaty which his brother had made, by his Order, without including any other condition, but this, that he might make his abode at <hi>Nancy,</hi> with all honours due to his quality; as alſo, the Cardinal his Brother; and that the Treaty being within three moneths particularly, that which ingag'd him to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver the Princeſs <hi>Marguerite</hi> into the Kings hands; his Majeſty ſhould reſtore him the City of <hi>Nancy,</hi> without more ado then demoliſhing the Fortifications, if his Majeſty ſhould ſo think fit. <hi>Monſieur le</hi> Cardinal, did the more willingly conſent unto theſe two Articles, in regard he pretended only to put things into a way of reaſon, not to extend the bounds of <hi>France,</hi> which was of it ſelf large enough to obtain as much glory, as his Majeſty could deſire; ſo that both of them having ſigned it, there wanted nothing but the execution of them. <hi>Monſieur le</hi> Cardinall was not ignorant how important it was, not to abandon <hi>Monſieur de Lorrain,</hi> or to leave him to his own honeſty, which poſſibly might have been ſhaken by the natural inconſtancy of his humour. So that he earneſtly laboured to perſwade him to meet his Majeſty in perſon, in order to the performance of his promiſes. He repreſented to him, that it would be the more glorious for him, in regard it would teſtifie unto all Princes, that he had not Depoſited <hi>Nancy</hi> upon compulſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; as alſo of great advantage, in regard it would be an ample demonſtration of his real intentions of ſubmitting his, unto his Majeſties Will: Who would thereupon be the more indulgent of him, and ſurrender <hi>Nancy</hi> unto him, as ſoon as ever he ſhould be aſſured he might be confident of his good deportment. Such were the charms of his words, that they perſwaded him to reſolve thereupon, that upon the 21 they departed together to wait upon the King. Approaching neer <hi>Nancy,</hi> the Cardinal haſted to acquaint the King, before the Cardinal <hi>de Lorrains</hi> comming, with the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret of the affair, and to adviſe him of ſuch things as were moſt conducing to his ſervice. All that appeared, was that <hi>Monſieur de Lorrain,</hi> ſaluting the King, bowed himſelf very low made his excuſed with a great deal of ſubmiſſion, aſſured him of the inclination he had to obey him; beſeeched him to forget what was paſt, to pardon him, and to believe that he would punctually perform the Treary. The King imbrac'd him with a cheerfull countenance, and told him, that he willingly accepted thoſe proffers of his ſervice and friendſhip, that he ſhould forget what was paſs'd, and that he forgave him. Afterwards, he led him into his Cabinet, where the Cardinal was with the chief of the Councel. Their entertainment was for ſome time upon ordinary diſcourſe, and many things were ſaid concerning the Dukes courage and inclination to Arms, which he did not unwillingly hear. The King told him, I muſt confeſſe, I have had an ill opinion of you, and when I found you perform'd not the Treaties, made by the Cardinal your Brother, which your ſelf had ratified, I ſhaid you had neither faith nor honeſty; but now in confidence of the promiſes you have made me to perform all, I begin to be of another opinion, and ſhall be ready to teſtifie the deſire I have to love you. <hi>Monſieur</hi> the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal took up the diſcourſe, and ſaid, Sirs, I ſhall willingly paſſe my word for the affection which <hi>Monſieur de Lorrain</hi> hath for you ſervice; and for the deſire he hath to live otherwiſe than heretofore. You ought to forget the occaſions of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content which your Majeſty hath receiv'd, and to believe, that his deportment for the future will be ſatisfactory; he muſt fight under your Colours, and in the head of your Troops. Hereupon <hi>Monſieur de Lorrain</hi> made great complements, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeching the King to receive him into his favour. The King re-interated the aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances of his good will; and it being Supper time, his Majeſty cauſed him to be conducted to <hi>Monſieur le Duc de la Valette's</hi> lodging, who his Majeſty had commanded to entertain him.

<pb n="571" facs="tcp:56802:291"/>there were many probable conjectures that he intended to ſave himſelf without making good any thing that he had promiſed. The reverend Father <hi>Joſeph,</hi> and the <hi>Sieur Bouthillier,</hi> went to wait upon him, to conclude upon the Orders for his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties entrance into <hi>Nancy;</hi> but he entertained the motions with ſo much coldneſs, that there could be no more doubt of it; however, becauſe it was not abſolutely certain, his Majeſty did forbear to ſeiz upon his perſon. The courſe he took by an admirable piece of Prundence, not to break the Laws of Hoſpitality, yet to prevent his getting off which would be much to his Majeſties damage, was the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding of divers truſty perſons to be near his Lodging, who without ſhew of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſt, might watch that he eſcaped them not. Indeed it had been a ſhame for the King to have ſuffered the Duke to have mock'd his Majeſty by an eſcape of that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and it had been as much weakneſſe as inconſiderateneſſe not to have ſtop'd him in his flight. It was abſolutely neceſſary indeed to obſerve the promiſe of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity given him, for his comming to execute the Treaty; which in caſe he refus'd to do, the King was not oblig'd to his word; and the Duke relying only upon the faith of his Treaty, might and ought to be ſtop'd; ſeeing the non-performance of it made him an enemy as before, and he could not be arreſted untill he had open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declare himſelf; but his evaſion diſcovering him ſufficiently, it had been im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudence to have ſuffered him to paſſe into <hi>Flanders,</hi> without ſecuring his perſon.</p>

Amongſt Gentlemen, it is a juſt ground for the cutting of Throats in Duels, and Soveraigns look upon it, as one of the moſt lawful occaſions of War. By Treaties of Peace they are made friends, the breach of which makes them enemies; and conſequently, they may freely be taken by the ſame Law, whereby it is permitted to ſecure an enemy where ever he be found. It is without reaſon that the infringers of them ſhould alledge their ſecurity, ſeeing themſelves have broke it.

The King went to receive her, at the Port of <hi>St. John,</hi> where the Regiment of <hi>Picardy</hi> was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>battelled; and ſhortly after her arrival, the Duke <hi>de Lorrain,</hi> accompanied by the Cardinal his brother, and the Princeſs <hi>de Falsbourg,</hi> went to do their devoirs to her, with more civility then joy: And thus was <hi>Nancy</hi> the Metropolitan City of <hi>Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain,</hi> whom the force of her Baſtions, and the largeneſſe of three great Motes ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to render impregnable, taken as ſoon as beſieg'd. It might have held out at leaſt two years; but his Majeſty aſſiſted by the ſage advices of the Cardinal, as he himſelf hath teſtified, took it in fourteen days.

Conqueſts have been atchieved beyond hope, and the diſpatch wherewith the King hath obtained, ſome rendreth thoſe example of Hiſtory now credible, which before were thought miraculous. Nor was the Order which his Majeſty took to keep this place, the leaſt conſiderable thing in this expedition: He committed the Government of it to the <hi>Sieur de Braſſac,</hi> a Gentleman of quality, newly return'd from an Embaſſie from <hi>Rome,</hi> whoſe ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and modeſty was as capable of perſwading the Inhabitants not to miſlike the change of their Maſter, as his fidelity and vigilance of aſſuring his Majeſty of his well keeping it.

He commanded the Magazeens to be ſtored with Ammunitions of all ſorts, he converted the fortifications which ſerved for a Communication between the new and the old Town into a Cittadel, where the Gariſon might be ſecure, in caſe the inhabitants ſhould mutiny, for the preventing of which he diſarm'd them.

The conduct of the Romans being full of ſweetneſs and moderation,
<pb n="573" facs="tcp:56802:292"/>begot them the affections of the Sagentines and Italians, after they had conquered them, who had preſerved them in their Soveraignty, whereas the harſh uſage of <hi>Hannibal</hi> cauſed him to loſe them, almoſt as ſoon as he had vanquiſhed them. I will adde ſome few particular Orders fit to be eſtabliſhed in a City, or among a people newly conquered to hold them in allegiance. It will not a litle conduce thereunto, to render them exact juſtice in their affairs, and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure them plenty of all kinds of proviſion, to countenance Piety, to careſſe the Nobility, and to gain the learned. Religious men ought not to be neglected, they ought rather to be courted and honoured by beſtowing Alms on them, and preſerving them in the juſt injoyment of their priviledges; for they have the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of the people in their hands, and the credit which they have acquired by their good life, procureth them ſo much authority, that whatever they do or ſay, is thought well done, well ſaid, and fit to be followed. But eſpecially it being not in the power of the beſt and wiſeſt Princes, to work by all the teſtimonies of their goodneſſe, upon the afflictions of a people naturally brutiſh, unreaſonable, and inſenſible of benefits, there ought to be no ſmall care taken in leaving a ſtrong gariſon among them that may aw them, and curb them in caſe of inſurrections; not but that their Commanders ought to be charged to keep them in ſuch order and moderation that the Inhabitants be not oppreſs'd by them. Beſides they ought to be diſarm'd of all thoſe things which may tend to inſurrections by Arms, I mean ſouldiers, warlike Engines, ſuch men as are capable of making parties, and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of all Towers and ſtrong places. Thus did <hi>Caeſar</hi> upon the ſurrender of any City, he commanded their Horſes and Arms to be delivered; and that all men of any valour or credit among the Inhabitants, ſhould be given him in hoſtage, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that this was the true way to ſecure them from any inſurrection, it being not enough to diſarm them, unleſſe they be depriv'd of men of credit and counſel, ſuch as are able under hand to procure others, and all ſuch Souldiers as are likely to be active. The Carthaginians made it appear by experience, when the Romans had totally diſarmed them, they finding a way to forge every day in their City an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Targets, and three hundred Swords, beſides Darts and Engines for throwing of Stones, and to make ropes of their Wives hair for want of Hemp. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, men of ſpirit and War, are more to be feared then Weapons, and there ought to be more care taken to ſecure ſuch men in a City, then all the Musquets, Pikes, and Piſtols.</p>

                  <p>AT the ſame time that the King diſpoſed his Armies, to hinder the unjuſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprizes of <hi>Monſieur de Lorrain;</hi> the houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> provided <hi>Aldringuer</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> and the Duke <hi>de Feria</hi> in <hi>Italy</hi> to meet neer <hi>Conſtance,</hi> and from thence to march into <hi>Alſace,</hi> and <hi>Lorrain,</hi> to ſecure him from ruine. The Duke had intelligence thereof; and for this reaſon it was, that he uſed many delays and indeavours to get into the Low Countries', hoping that if <hi>Nancy</hi> could hold out ſix weeks or two moneths, theſe two Armies might come in good time to defend his intereſt. Upon this ſcore it was, that the Cardinal who knoweth how to reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy inconveniences before they happen, preſſed ſo hard upon him, that he forc'd him to conclude the Treaty, perſwaded his Majeſty to ſend the Swedes to come to meet <hi>Feria</hi> and <hi>Aldringuer</hi> to hinder their march into <hi>Alſace,</hi> and to leave the Marſhal <hi>de la Force</hi> in <hi>Lorrain,</hi> with an army of twenty thouſand men. He had order to hinder any inſurrections or enterpriſes which might be made by the Dukes indeavours; as alſo to ſend ſuch aſſiſtance to the Swedes as they ſhould deſire, the better to give a check to the proceedings of theſe two Generals. The ſtrict intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence between the King and Swedes, obliged Marſhal <hi>Horn</hi> to march towards <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria's</hi> Quarters; and as there is nothing ſeems impoſſible to Conquerors, he uſed

They were not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed alone imploy'd in the defence of thoſe two Princes, for the Marſhal <hi>de la Force</hi> ſent by his Majeſties order, part of his Army into ſome of their Towns; the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſſe <hi>de Bourbonne,</hi> one of the Marſhals <hi>de Camp,</hi> marched with ſix hundred men into <hi>Morbelliard,</hi> belonging to the Duke <hi>de Wirtenberg,</hi> and ſecur'd it from all violence, by his valour, prudence, vigilance, and zeal for his Majeſties glory, four fortifications able to ſecure any place.

                  <head>That it is wiſdom to aſsault an Enemy with the forces of allied Princes in his march.</head>
                  <p>A Prince who ſeeth his enemies Army reſolute to aſſault him amidſt his new conqueſts, doth a great deal better to prevent him by meeting him, than to expect him. I have in other place given the reaſons. This courſe did the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans take in all their great expeditions, excepting in the War with the <hi>Gaules</hi> and ſecond <hi>Punick,</hi> which they could never terminate until they had paſs'd the Sea and Alps with their Armies. He who would ſpare his Troops, or employ them in other deſignes, ſhall do it beſt if he ſend to ſtop his march, and ſo to divert him either in his own Countrey, or in the paſſages by the interpoſition of his Alleys, that he may not be able to advance.

<pb n="575" facs="tcp:56802:293"/>in <hi>Aſrick</hi> with <hi>Antiochus</hi> to go fight them in Italy, which ſucceeded very fortunately.

To adde ſome reaſons to examples, is it not true which <hi>Craeſus</hi> ſaid to <hi>Cyrus,</hi> when he exhorted him to aſſault <hi>Thomyris</hi> in her own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, if you expect your enemy to come to you, he'l commit a thouſand deva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtations, and in caſe you ſhould looſe a Battle, he will not be content with the Victory, but will proſecute it to the overrunning of your whole Country? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides there is little hazarded by cauſing him, to be aſſaulted in his march by Allies or in his own Country, for it preſerveth an Army entire againſt a time of need.

An Enemies Army likewiſe marching through anothers Coutrey where he ſindeth oppoſition, muſt neceſſarily diminiſh his forces by ſickneſs, fighting and the like, whereas his will remain in its full vigour, and conſequently the better able to reſiſt him. Thus will he be able to obtain his deſign, which is to prevent his comming into his Countrey, a thing of the more advantage, in regard he may ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect it without danger, and preſerve his Army freſh to aſſiſt his Alleys, in caſe they are unable of themſelfs to make good the paſſages.</p>

The Cardinal did not a little contribute to thoſe his cares, nor did he omit any opportunity to teſtifie unto the Queen-Mother the earneſt deſire he had to ſerve her, ſo that at laſt ſhe was forc'd to yeild her ſelf, in ſo much that it was verily thought ſhe would quickly have re-aſſum'd her for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ſentiments of love for the King, and confidence in the Cardinal; but for thoſe damnable counſels which thoſe whom ſhe honoured with her ear, infus'd into her, eſpecially Father <hi>Chanteloupe</hi> who unable to make himſelf conſiderable, unleſs in broiles did alwayes prefer a ſtorm before a calm.

It is true indeed that thinking
<pb n="576" facs="tcp:56802:294"/>to cover his malice with a ſpecious vaile, he beſeech'd the Cardinal to exclude him as unwilling, that his perſon ſhould hinder a good accommodation, but that only ſerv'd the better to ſet him forth, ſeeing it was moſt certain that his excluſion would hinder the Queen-Mothers return, and that on the contrary it was only to make the Cardinal more odious unto her, whom he knew not to be ſo imprudent, or diſaffectio nate to his Majeſties ſervice, as to ſuffer his return. He knew diſtruſt to be the greateſt obſtacle in the Accommodations of Great men, who were never to be reconciled, but by a mutual confidence, whereupon he labour'd nothing more, then to infuſe it, into the mind of this Great Princeſſe, as the very ſame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the <hi>Sieur de Laleu</hi> teſtifieth, which required him to ſay, that her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties returning into France, would hazard all, that the Cardinal would deſtroy her when he pleas'd, without her being able to prevent it, or to hurt him, in caſe ſhe had a mind to it, and that ſhe doubted whether the Cardinal had not ſome-diſtruſt of her, though he had above twenty times declared unto her, how paſſionatly deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous be was of her return, ſo that it was eaſy to be known by this Procedure of Father <hi>Chanteloupe,</hi> that with one hand he did proſecute the accommodation, and with the other obſtructed it, and that he could not better be compar'd then to him, who calling all people to quench a fire doth underhand endeavour to make it burn the more. This was not the only teſtimony that the Courts of <hi>Bruſſels</hi> made evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of the misfortunes, whereunto Grandees are expoſed, when they ſuffer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be tranſported by ambitious Miniſters, who prefer their own before their Maſters intereſt.

Had Monſieur known he might have been ſecure in France, that the King deſir'd nothing with more paſſion, than to ſee him partake of his glory and recreation, and that his Majeſty lov'd him like a Son; he would not have ſlaied 24.

<pb n="577" facs="tcp:56802:294"/>the extremities into which he had run, and the inalterable reſolution wherein he had fixed the Queen-Mother not to forſake him; ſurely there was not much more confidence to be put in <hi>Puy-Laurens,</hi> upon the ſcore of his inclination, and for fear leſt he might once again make uſe of <hi>Monſieurs</hi> perſon, to raiſe another civil War in <hi>France,</hi> or leſt he might a fourth time carry him out of <hi>France,</hi> upon the leaſt cauſe of miſtruſt.

                  <p>IT is great wiſedom not to haſten any Treaty wherein there may be any danger to the State, It is moſt certain in general, that precipitation is an enemy to wiſe counſels, that inſtead of ending affairs it imbroileth them, and that it hath alwaies been receiv'd for an ill ſervant, becauſe being blind and without foreſight, it ſeldom makes any Treaties which are not diſadvantagious; but moſt particularly true it is, in ſuch Treaties as are concluded where the parties are not well diſpos'd to keep a Peace though they ſeem very plauſible at firſt ſight, yet are they ſeldom of long continuance, by reaſon of the ſharpnes remaining in their minds when they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, which coming to increaſe by ſome new diſcontents, diviſion preſently re-aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumeth her firſt place, and thus inſtead of any ſatisfaction from it, there oftentimes ariſe more cauſes of repentance. In effect they ought to be the further from end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing affairs, becauſe the eaſineſſe of concluding them, hath often begotten more diſtruſts among great men, than if there had been great difficulties in the making their peace. Hatred doth eaſily revive among Princes, and they ſooner forget any thing then injuries they pretend to have received, which though for ſome time they diſſemble, yet are they never deficient to teſtifie their reſentments, when they find opportunity proper for it. There were heretofore divers accommodations made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Lewis</hi> the Eleventh, and <hi>Charls Duc de Borgogne,</hi> which ſeemed to ſettle their States in peace, but as they were oftentimes made more by neceſſity on the Dukes part, which rather forc'd him then inclin'd him to live in friendſhip with the King; the main buſineſs was ſtill to be begun anew; nor was any thing but death able to
<pb n="578" facs="tcp:56802:295"/>give a period to their diviſions. How often hath the houſe of <hi>Orleans</hi> and <hi>Bour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogne</hi> been reconcil'd, yet alwaies to little purpoſe, becauſe the Princes not laying by the hatred which was between them, did preſently fly out again upon the leaſt cauſe of ſuſpicion. <hi>Henry</hi> the Third, wrought nothing upon the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> by pardoning him, for he forbore not to proſecute the enterprizes which his Ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſuggeſted. They who are little acquainted in State-affairs, are not very ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous of the great trouble which is in making Peace between Princes, but think that it is enough ſo they are made friends; yet it may ſo fall out that great inconveniences may ariſe from want of care, when civil Wars break out again, which they re-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging in may indanger the whole State, at leaſt afford Forraigners great advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. It is much better that Grandees ſhould continue out of the Kingdom in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord and impotency, that in the Court or in ſome Province, where they might eaſily raiſe Cabals and inſurrections I think that raſh conſiderations may not more fitly be compar'd to any thing then to too quick a digeſtion, which as Phyſicians ſay, repleniſheth the body with many crudities, the cauſe of divers diſeaſes; and it of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten happens that ſuch conſiderations like jealouſies and new differences, ſerve only to ſow the ſeeds of civil Wars; ſo that better it is to defer the reſolution of them for ſome time, than to precipitate them into a ſhort continuance, and a production of new broils.</p>

                  <p>ABout the end of this year there happened great diſputes between: <hi>Meſſieur Henry de Sourdis</hi> Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> and the <hi>Duc de Eſpernon,</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of <hi>Guyenne.</hi> The Arch Biſhop whoſe <hi>Genius</hi> is capable of all kind of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments had charge during the ſiege of <hi>Rochel,</hi> of ſome men of War in this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, by a particular Commiſſion exempted from all other dependances; and the Duke who was of an humour never to let feathers be pluck'd out of his wings, did not a little reſent it, though for the preſent he diſſembled it, expecting an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to ſhew it with the more advantage, which did not ſo ſoon offer it ſelf, the Arch Biſhop being imployed at Court, and at <hi>Poiton</hi> in his Majeſties ſervice; but as he had no leſſe memory then courage, he preſerv'd the memory of it untill the latter end of this year, at which time the Arch-Biſhop return'd to <hi>Bourdeaux.</hi> The cuſtom of this City, is that the Jurats go to wait on the Arch-Biſhop at the Bridge as often as he cometh from the Country. The Duke to prevent him of this honor, ſent for them that afternoon, that he ſhould come to Town, and entertained them either upon ſome affairs which he was willing to conclude or by ſome other devices, until the Arch-Biſhop was arrived at his Palace. The Jurats indeavoured to make their excuſes to the Arch-Biſhop for their not receiving him, but he was not very well ſatisfied with it, no more then with a trick the Duke put upon him, ſome days after,<note place="margin">Which is an Of<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

Now the Maſter of the Arch-Biſhops Palace comming to the <hi>Clie</hi> to buy fiſh, was refuſed to be admitted, upon pretext that the priviledge of the Capital <hi>de Buch,</hi> had not as yet been ſerved. This affront was more prejudicial to the Arch-Biſhops table, then perſon; however he complained of it with formalities of juſtice, which ſerved to exaſperate the matter. For the Duke moved at it, put the ſame af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front on him ſome few days after, upon a time when he had deſigned to entertain the Jurats and other Officers of the Town, by ſending his Guards to hinder the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the <hi>Clie,</hi> and the Arch-Biſhops ſervants comming to force it were beaten. It was further reported, how that the Duke to prevent the Arch-Biſhops receiving fiſh from any other place, had ſet guards upon the Paſſages which led to the Arch-Biſhoprick, with order to ſearch thoſe who ſhould go in, and to take away their fiſh if they had any about them. The Arch-Biſhop provok'd at this procedure re-itera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="579" facs="tcp:56802:295"/>his complaints to the Attorney General, and the Jurats, and made them ſign di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers inſtruments proteſting to complain unto the King accuſing certain men cloth'd in Coats of ſad green, with white croſſes, but without declaring them to be the Dukes guards. Theſe ſecond complaints were no more to his advantage then the former; on the other ſide, the Duke commanded <hi>Naugas</hi> Lievtenant of his guards, to take an occaſion to meet the Arch-Biſhop in the ſtreets of <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> and to preſent his guards unto him, beſeeching him to take notice of thoſe who had diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleas'd him, and aſſuring him that he had never given any command with deſign to offend him, or to ſtop the Paſſages to his Palace. <hi>Naugas</hi> wanted not a fair oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to execute what he was commanded, and going with twenty of his Maſters guard, met the Arch-Biſhop in <hi>St. Andrews</hi> Cloiſter, as he was returning from the City in his Coach. He ſtop'd the Coach-man, and took the Horſes by the bridles; and told him confuſedly in the uproar that was then made, that he came in behalf of the Governour Duke, to preſent to him thoſe men cloath'd with a ſad green, and white croſſes, and to tell him they belong'd to him, to the end he might know thoſe whom he pretended had offended them; aſſuring him in the <hi>interim,</hi> that he had not commanded any one to diſpleaſe him. This paſſage made a great noiſe, being of great ſcandal to ſome, though others laugh'd at it. The Arch-Biſhop ſeem'd highly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>o reſent it, and having aſſembled his Clergy to propoſe the injury offered his perſon, and to take their advice upon it; it was concluded that <hi>Naugas</hi> ſhould be Excommunicated; but before the Publication of it, to ſend two Canons, two Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates, and two men in Orders to the Duke, to complain unto him of his guards; and to underſtand if it had been done by his command. The Duke receiv'd his Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties with civility, but that he might not tranſgreſs in his anſwer, he deſir'd that they would give him their deſire in writing. The Arch-Biſhop was acquainted there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, who thereupon aſſembled his Clergy the ſecond time; and the reſult was to to publiſh the next morning, being All-Saints day, the cenſure of Excommunication againſt <hi>Naugas</hi> and his adherents. <hi>Naugas</hi> advis'd of this cenſure, appeal'd againſt it as an abuſe, gave notice of his appeal to the Arch-Biſhop, and the Duke having aſſembled in his houſe all the Profeſſors of the Canon Law, together with a great many religious, to have their advice upon this cenſure, where he propos'd to them the matter in his own form; whereupon the moſt part of them were of opinion, that there was ſome exception to be taken againſt the cenſure; and ſaid that all the forms being not obſerv'd, they thought that thoſe againſt whom it was pronounc'd were not oblig'd by it. The Duke preſently publiſhed their opinion by ſound of Trumpet; at which the Arch-Biſhop was ſo angry that without conſidering the impoſſibility for thoſe religious perſons, not to wait upon the Duke being ſent for, that they had not given their judgement; but upon the fact as he had propos'd it unto them, and that this their advice was not definitive, only a bare teſtimony of their opinions, like thoſe of Lawyers, which are uſual in all affairs, and upon judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments wherin his Majeſty himſelf is concern'd, he reſolv'd to chaſtiſe them withrigor. This advice was conformable to that which the Biſhop of <hi>Nantes,</hi> a Prelate whoſe reputation is clear, his life without blemiſh, and whoſe conſcience is without com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare, gave the Duke upon the ſame fact propos'd unto him by his Letters, ſent to him for fear leſt thoſe Doctors and religious men, might be led by complaiſance to incline too much to his intereſt; however ſuch was the Arch-Biſhops diſcontent, that he iſſued out a ſentence whereby all thoſe who had been of that opinion which the Duke had publiſhed, were condemn'd as guilty of his perſon and dignity, were inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted their charges and Eccleſiaſtical functions, prohibited to Preach the Word of God, to hear confeſſions, adminiſter Sacraments in the Dioceſs of <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding the ſuperiour Provincials, to chaſtize them, and expel them out of the Covents of <hi>Bourdeaux.</hi> The heat of his diſcontent was ſuch, that it tranſport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him ſo far as not to have any reſpect to the priviledges granted to Religious Orders, by the Holy See, by which all Prelates are inhibited to make any cenſures againſt them, upon penalty of drawing that Excommunication their own head, which they intend to inflict upon others. The Religious hereupon appeal'd from this ſentence to the Pope, alledging that it had been decreed againſt them without au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority;
<pb n="580" facs="tcp:56802:296"/>but the Arch-Biſhop unwilling to put up the lie, aſſembled the ſuperiors of the Religious houſes in his Palace, to condemn that opinion which they had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in favour of <hi>Naugas.</hi> The Duke having notice hereof, deſign'd to prevent this aſſembly; to which end, he commanded the <hi>Chevalier du Guet</hi> of the City of <hi>Bourdeaux</hi> to beſet the Arch-Biſhops Palace with his Archers, and to hinder any Religious perſon from entring in, pretending it might diſturb the publique Peace, for which by his charge he was oblig'd to provide. The Arch-Biſhop was very ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly diſpleas'd to ſee his deſigns ſo forcibly countermin'd and not reſolved ſo to relinquiſh them, he went in perſon to the Religious, to carry them to his Palace, a reſolution which was the cauſe of all the misfortune that happened, what had paſs'd till then being look'd upon by moſt people, only as a gallantry of ſpirit. The Duke having never learn'd patience enough to ſuffer the Arch-Biſhop to incroach upon his power, by any Eccleſiaſtical priviledge, went to meet him in perſon with his guards, and ſome other Gentlemen, at the entrance of the Cathedral Cloiſter, and the Arch-Biſhop coming thither, he went up to him, ſpoke ſome angry words, ſtruck off his Hat and Cap, and as ſome witneſſes depos'd in the information taken, by authority of Parliament, put the end of the ſtick which he had in his hand, to his breaſt. This Procedure made a great noiſe in the City, and the Arch-Biſhop loſing no time, the very next morning, being the eleventh of <hi>November,</hi> aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled thoſe of his Clergy, and by common conſent Excommunicated the Duke and his Aſſiſtants, interdicted the Cities and Suburbs of <hi>Bourdeaux</hi> and <hi>Cadillac.</hi> The Parliament ſeeing this great trouble, did what they could to make an accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation; but it was to little purpoſe, all they could obtain was that the Parliament might hear maſſe in the Palace Chappel. He likewiſe ſent to the King informations of what had paſs'd, whereupon his Majeſty ſent order to the Arch-Biſhop to take away the interdiction, and to the Duke to go to his houſe of <hi>Plaſſac,</hi> which is out of the Dioceſs of <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> to expect the Popes reſolution, to whom the deciſion of that controverſie properly belong'd, ſeeing they had appeal'd to his Holineſs, which hung in ſuſpence about five or ſix moneths, nor was it ended untill the yeer following, till when I forbear to ſay any more of it.</p>

                  <head>That much reſpect hath been alwaies given to Prelates and Biſhops.</head>
                  <p>THe Function of Prelates and Prieſts is ſo eminent and holy that all people, nay Emperors themſelves, have been oblig'd to reſpect them. <hi>Plutarch</hi> alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the cauſe, ſaith, it is becauſe they pray to the Gods not only for themſelves and friends, but for all mankind. The Romans in the times of Paganiſm, did ſo much honour them, that the Prieſts of <hi>Jupiter</hi> going in the City, had a <hi>Lictor,</hi> and a <hi>cella curulis,</hi> and condemned <hi>Cneux Cornelius Praetor</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> for having injuriouſly diſputed with <hi>Aemilius Lepidus</hi> the High Prieſt. <hi>Alexander Severus</hi> had ſo great a reſpect to them in ſuch cauſes where religion was intereſſed, that he was not of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended when their judgements were contrary to his; and how reſpectfully did <hi>Alexander</hi> treat the High Prieſt of the Jews, when in his fury going to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> with a deſign to ruine it, he met him comming in his <hi>Pontiſicalibus,</hi> he was not only appeas'd; but as the Hiſtory ſaith, worſhipped God in his perſon with a great deal of reverence. All Pagans in general have next to their Kings aſcrib'd the chief place to their Prieſts, and held it a great crime to offend them. If the light of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath induc'd them ſo to reſpect them, Chriſtianity obligeth us to honour them much more, ſeeing Biſhops are receiv'd for Fathers and Paſtors of the Church, for the Succeſſors of Religion, and the Paſtors of Jeſus Chriſt; they ought to be reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected as the Law of well-living, as certain rules of good works, as Angels who have intelligence of the myſteries of our faith, and who are more purified by the flames of the Holy Ghoſt; they ought to be reſpected as perſons of an eminent dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, who ought to have their minds rais'd in the contemplation of heavenly things, to live in a noble ſcorn of al earthly things, as ſo ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>y bright ſtars, whoſe luſtre is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſullied by the Clouds of Vice, as heavenly men who have familiar converſe with
<pb n="581" facs="tcp:56802:296"/>God, as living books of the true Doctrine, as the true Organs of Chriſtianity, and the <hi>Idea</hi> by which the people ought to frame their lives. <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the great, ſaid, he did not conſider them as common men, but as ſo many Thrones where the Divinity inhabited; for which reaſon, he could not indure that any ſhould ſpeak of them ſlightly, and threatned thoſe with death who offended him, as is to be ſeen in Hiſtory, and chiefly commanded all governours of Provinces eſpecially to honour them. I ſhall likewiſe add, a particular care in puniſhing thoſe who injure them. Hiſtory is full of examples which the brevity of theſe maximes give me not leave to inſert. I ſhall only add, that Prelates to render themſelves wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of this extraordinary honour, are oblig'd to contain themſelves within the limits of their condition; becauſe as the ſhadow cannot be without the body, ſo it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable to pretend to glory, without meriting it by virtue.</p>

                  <head>An Edict to abate ſuperfluous expences.</head>
                  <p>THough the Forraign Wars undertaken by his Majeſty of late years conſum'd great ſums of money, and forc'd the King to levy great Taxes, which did not a little diminiſh private mens Revenues; yet ſuch was the fruitfulneſſe of <hi>France,</hi> that they found means to ſatisfie their natural inclination of going richly cloath'd. His Majeſty diſlik'd the ill deportment of many, who notwithſtanding the great ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities of the State, did not ceaſe to make ſuperfluous expences in Stuffs, Embroide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, gold and ſilver, Laces Bone-laces, and other like vanities, not to be permitted but in a full and long Peace. It was the more needfull to redreſs theſe diſorders, becauſe for the ſatisfying of ſuch exceſſive curioſities, there was a great deal of ſilver tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported out of <hi>France,</hi> which thereby was much impoveriſhed, whereby his Majeſty was diſabled at a time of need to raiſe monies for the ſupplying of his occaſions, or to exact thoſe contributions which the glory and intereſt of his ſtate did really re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire. Theſe reaſons oblig'd him to make an Edict in the moneth of <hi>December,</hi> by which the wearing of any Stuffs, Embroideries, gold and ſilver lace, or any bone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace of above nine Livres the Ell, was prohibited upon pain of confiſcation, and ſix hundred Livres to be levied on them, on them who ſhould wear it, and a thouſand Crowns upon the Merchants who ſhould ſell it. His Majeſty knowing how power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full the example of a Soveraign is amongſt his people, taught the French by his ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit how to follow this rule, and was ſo carefull in it, that this Edict was better obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved then any of the like quality had a long time been.</p>

               <div type="section">
                  <head>That Edicts inhibiting ſuperfluous Expences, are profitable both to Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign and People.</head>
                  <p>EDicts which forbid vain Expences, are no leſſe profitable to Soveraigns than the people, eſpecially in times of War. Private mens plenty is the Princes trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, which he may make uſe of in time of neceſſity; and as it cannot be preſerv'd without frugality, which prohibiteth the uſe of unneceſſary things; ſo there is no way better to lay the foundations of it, then to eſtabliſh it by law. It is impoſſible he ſhould make War without laying extraordinary contributions on the people, at leaſt for the maintenance of an Army in that honour ſo long as is needfull. How ſhould the people aſſiſt him at a time of need, if ſuperfluous expences ſhould exhauſt their Wealth. They may indeed be ſo preſs'd that any thing may be extracted from them, but that muſt be by force, whereby not only their ill will, but a thouſand im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>precations folow their monies. It may be objected that great men who are the moſt ſubject to theſe expences, do not pay any tax or aid to their Soveraign: But I reply that being imploi'd in the War where a great maſſe of money is conſum'd, they contribute more then the people to the publick charge, and by conſequence ought to live in the more order and frugality. Nobility impoveriſhed cannot ſerve when occaſion requires, but is forc'd to keep at home, whereas they who perſerve their wealth, by the means of a well regulated expence, may put himſelf in a equipage to
<pb n="582" facs="tcp:56802:297"/>appear in an Army in a quality becomming their honour. Exceſſive expences are uſually made in ſuch commodities as come from forraign Countries, nor can a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign permit the uſe of them without enriching him, from whom they are brought to the impoveriſhment of his own; which State, if it be an enemy, or powerfull enough to render it ſelf ſuſpected, it were not only to deprive his own of the means to reſiſt him, but to give new force to that Forraigner to attempt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him. In fine, the neceſſities of man are ſatisfied with ſo little, that it were very unreaſonable to make vaſt expences upon commodities of no uſe, and from which there is not that ſatisfaction to be receiv'd as in convenience. Content your ſelves with that which is enough, ſaith <hi>St. Auſtine,</hi> the reſt ſerveth only to make the life more burthenſom, inſtead of refreſhing it from care, and ſuperfluous expences, which are made for the obtaining of an apparent honour, have very troubleſom conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences.</p>

                  <head>A Difference between the Biſhops and Religious, decided by a Judgement from the Councel.</head>
                  <p>ALthough the Cardinal had made up by his admirabl dexterity in the foregoing yeer, ſome differences which were mov'd between the Biſhops and Religious by perſwading the latter to condiſcend to ſome Articles, to which no man elſe could have brought them; yet ſo it was, that ſome troubleſom ſpirits publiſh'd books, ſome for one part, and ſome for another. The main ground of the quarrel, was concerning a word which was found in ſome manuſcripts of a Canon of the ſecond Counſel of <hi>Orange,</hi> and not in others. They who were for the Religious, raiſed this conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence from it, That Confirmation was not abſolutely neceſſary after Baptiſm: Thoſe on the other ſide, unable to ſalve the matter, maintained the contrary. All that the Laws of Hiſtory permit me to ſay, is, that the conſequence rais'd by thoſe for the Religious, was very dangerous; becauſe it might be inferr'd that the Biſhops in <hi>England,</hi> might be eaſily paſs'd by, ſeeing all the exerciſes of Chriſtianity, might be practic'd there by the Catholicks, excepting confirmation only. The heat of this diſpute did ſometimes tranſport them beyond the bounds of Doctrine, and to fall foul upon ſome Subjects, which could not but give ſome advantage to Hereticks, and trouble the Conſciences of many tenderly affected, and diſturb the publick quiet. The courſe at firſt taken was, to prohibit the Printing of Books of this nature, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out leave obtain'd from the grand Chancellery; but the Doctors of Divinity of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi> not ſatisfied therewith, ordered in one of their Aſſemblies that the books of <hi>Pere Sirmond,</hi> made to maintain that word, ſhould be re-examined; ſo that this was the occaſion of publiſhing without priviledge certian books repugnant to that Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an peace and charity, which ought eſpecially to be between Eccleſiaſticks. The King took notice thereof, and not to leave it unremedied, commanded <hi>Monſieur le Garde des Seaux</hi> to take care in it; who order'd that the books printed and publiſhed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the name of <hi>Pere Sirmond,</hi> and <hi>Petrus Aurelius;</hi> the two chief of the parties, ſhould be examin'd by nine Doctors of Divinity, prohibited them upon penalty of corporal puniſhment, to determine any thing in their Aſſemblies concerning theſe books, and all Book-ſellers to ſell them without permiſſion under the Great Seal. Some Prelates more zealous then wiſe in matter of the Kings priviledge, complain'd of this Arreſt, pretending it was not the cuſtom for Kings to intermeddle with the Doctrine of the Church; but they were not long unanſwer'd; for <hi>Monſieur le Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de des Seaux,</hi> was too well acquainted with the King his Maſters power, and too wel vers'd in the reading of good books, to be ignorant how Kings and Emperors have alwaies taken cogniſance of affairs of this nature, and determin'd them in order to the good of their State, and the continuation of the publick quiet.</p>

                  <head>The Power which Kings have in Eccleſiaſtical Affairs.</head>
                  <p>THe Power which Kings have in Eccleſiaſtical affairs. Though God hath chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fly put the Scepter into the hands of Kings and Emperors to exerciſe a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral power over their people; yet cuſtom obligeth them to know that they have no ſmall authority in Eccleſiaſtical affairs. There need no more ancient example then that of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the firſt Chriſtian Emperour. Doth not every one know that he call'd himſelf Biſhop of ſuch things as paſs'd out of the Church, that writing to the Biſhops, he told them he took part of their miniſtry to be the more carefull of the Church? And in fine, he undertook the management thereof, with ſo much zeal and Prudence that his actions acquir'd him the Title of Founder of Law and Religion, as is to be ſeen in an ancient inſcription. It was with no little trouble and care that he quieted the Church in the time of <hi>Arius,</hi> that he aſſembled divers Counſels upon his Doctrine, and that he prohibited the reading of his books. To ſhew that his procedure was without uſurpation; every one may ſee in Hiſtory that the Popes themſelves, and particular Clergies likewiſe, have from time to time, made their addreſſes to Emperors to be by them countenanc'd in affairs which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned unto them. The Clergy and Monks of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> beſeech'd <hi>Theodoſius</hi> and <hi>Valentinian</hi> to be ſolicitous of the Church, and to ſuppreſs Hereſies. Whereupon thoſe two Emperors commanded <hi>St. Cyril,</hi> to examine the Doctrine of <hi>Neſtorius.</hi> The Biſhops of the Counſel of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> beſeech'd <hi>Theodoſius</hi> to confirm their Decree; and Pope <hi>Boniſace</hi> acknowledg'd ſo great a power to the Emperor <hi>Hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi> in Eccleſiaſtical affairs, that he intreated him to make a Decree to prohibit all kind of under-hand dealing in the Election of the Popes. I could eaſily prove this cuſtom by the examples of ſuceeding Emperors; but I had rather ſhew that our Kings have uſually done the like: For <hi>Clouis</hi> the firſt of thoſe that imbrac'd Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, made divers Ordinances for the miniſtery of the Church, as he himſelf hath written in a Letter to the Biſhops of <hi>France,</hi> to be ſeen at this preſent intire and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defac'd for above eleven ages. He aſſembled the Biſhops of <hi>Orleans</hi> in a Couſel, where it was prohibited to admit any of his Subjects to be Clerks, without his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties permiſſion, and at their intreaty, he confirm'd their Canons. I will go a little further, and ſay, that Eccleſiaſtical perſons being born Subjects of a Soveraign Prince; their Kings have reciev'd power from God with their Crowns to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine their perſonal cauſes, where the good of the State may be intereſſed, a thing not to be doubted of; that the power of judging, is inſeparably annex'd unto that of the Soveraignty; and that he who is a Princes Subject, is of neceſſity to ſubmit to his Juſtice; and that Eccleſiaſtiques cannot deny themſelves to be Subjects, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as hath been already ſaid, the greateſt Poper themſelves have not made any dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty to put themſelves in this rank; as <hi>Gelaſius</hi> in a Letter which he writ to the Emperor <hi>Anaſtaſius Pelagius</hi> the firſt, in profeſſion of his Faith, which he ſent to <hi>Childebert</hi> one of our firſt Kings; and <hi>St Gregory</hi> to the Emperor <hi>Maurice.</hi> What reaſon can they pretend to reſiſt it, ſeeing Jeſus Chriſt himſelf and St. <hi>Paul</hi> have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg'd themſelves to be ſubject to their power. Did not Jeſus Chriſt tell <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late</hi> by way of acknowledging his Authority, that he could have no power over him but what he receiv'd from heaven? whereupon <hi>St. Auſtine,</hi> and <hi>St. Bernard,</hi> expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding thoſe words ſay, that <hi>Pilates</hi> ſentence, though very unjuſt was not uſurp'd, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he had a lawfull authority. So likewiſe <hi>St. Paul</hi> thinking himſelf happy to walk in the ſteps of his Maſters humility, did not appeal from <hi>Feſtus</hi> his Tribunal, to that of <hi>St. Peter;</hi> but to that of <hi>Caeſar</hi> acknowledging his power and authority of judging in that affair then in queſtion. Nor are the Diſciples greater then their Maſters.</p>
